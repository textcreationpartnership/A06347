            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lorde,<note place="margin">Lactan. lib. 4 de vera. ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. cap. 30.</note> Lactantius hath very properly and fitly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of trueth, the houſe and dwelling place of faith, and the Temple of God, adioyning withall, that if there bee any whiche entreth not into this Temple: or if there bee any that goe out thereof, hee is ſhut out from the hope of life, and from eternall ſaluation. For euen as in the time of the vniuerſall flood, none could bee ſaued, whiche were out of Noe his Arke:<note place="margin">Gene. 7.20.23.</note> ſo without the Churche, there is neither hope, nor faith, nor grace, nor ſaluation. Whiche thing alſo, the Apoſtle Saint Paul did verie well declare and meane, when beeing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to excommunicate ſome, and to caſte
<pb facs="tcp:3532:4"/> them out of the Churche,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5, 3.5. 1. Tim. 1.20</note> hee ſaide, hee muſte deliuer them vnto Satan. For as Ieſus Chriſt reigneth in the Churche: ſo Satan reigneth without the ſame: and as they whiche are in the Church, hauing Ieſus Chriſte for their head are in very good ſtate &amp; bleſſed: ſo they which are out of the Churche, hauing the Diuell for their head, cannot but be wicked and accurſed. And therfore it is ſaid, both in Iſaiah &amp; in Ioel, That in Sion and in Ieruſalem there ſhalbe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.<note place="margin">Iſaia 46.13. Ioel. 2.32.</note> There being meant by Syon and Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem the Church of God: as alſo by the worde <hi>heauen</hi> there is meant the ſame thing in the Apocalips, when S. Iohn ſaith, I hearde a great and lowde voice,<note place="margin">Reue. 12.10.</note> ſaying, Nowe is ſaluation in heauen. On the other ſide wee reade, that when God declareth, that hee will vtterly roote out ſome, from the heauenly life, hee denounceth againſt them and threateneth:<note place="margin">Ezech. 13.9.</note> That they ſhall not be in the counſell &amp; aſſemblie of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither written in the role of his ſeruantes. And Dauid very well knewe and felt this, when ſometimes being in exile, all griefes and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, were vnto him tollerable, and as a man woulde ſay eaſie to beate, excepting this, that hee was depriued of, and wanted the ſolemne aſſemblies, wherein men made publike declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:3532:4"/> and proteſtation, of Gods religion and ſeruice. Wherefore be wailing his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe hee was excluded from the viſible Churche, hee beeing alſo ſhut out from acceſſe or comming to the Tabernacle, by the crueltie and tyrannie of his enemies, hee cryed out earneſtly and ſaide, O Lord of hoſtes how ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are thy Tabernacles?<note place="margin">Pſalm. 84.1.2.4.10.</note> My ſoule longeth yea &amp; fainteth, for the courtes of the Lorde, for my hearte and my fleſhe leape for ioy in the liuing God. And a little after, Bleſſed are they which dwell in thy houſe, they will euer prayſe thee. For a day in thy courtes is better then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other wheis, I had rather bee a doore kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the houſe of my God, then to dwell in the Tabernacles of the wicked: For thereby hee hath declared that the condition of thoſe men, which beſtowe their life (yea although it were but a day long) in the ſeruice of God, in the middeſt of the Church, &amp; among faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is farre more bleſſed then theirs, who liue (though it were neuer ſo long) out of Gods houſe, and in the midſt of thoſe, out of whoſe companie, their religion is baniſhed. To which purpoſe alſo belongeth that, which the ſame Prophete ſingeth in an other Pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 27.4.</note> One thing haue I deſired of the Lorde, that I will
<pb facs="tcp:3532:5"/> require, euen that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beautie of the Lorde, and to viſit his Temple. And againe when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106.45</note> Remember, or haue mercie on mee O Lorde, with the fauour and good will of the people, and viſite mee with thy ſaluation: That I may ſet the good thinges of thy choſen ones, and reioyce in the ioy of thy people, and glory with thine inheritaunce. And for this verie cauſe and occaſion, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Hebrwes commendeth &amp; praiſeth Moſes,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24.25.</note> when hee ſaith: That by faith, hee beeing come to age, refuſed to bee called the ſonne of Pharaoh his daughter: choſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer aduerſitie with the people of God, then to inioy the pleaſures of ſinne, for a ſhort ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if wee woulde, that GOD ſhoulde gouerne vs by his holy ſpirite, (to the ende to make vs inioy and poſſeſſe his ſpirituall and heauenly good thinges, whiche hee giueth not but vnto his children alone, the members of Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne) and by conſequent, if wee woulde bee ſaued and made bleſſed, wee ought to hold and keepe our ſelues, firme, ſure, and well ſtaied in the Churche, ſo that there
<pb facs="tcp:3532:5"/> bee no force of tyrants, no violence of ſtormes and tempeſtes, no perſecution of enemies, no promiſes no threatnings, nor (to bee ſhort) any thing els, which may turne vs away, or cauſe vs to ſeparate our ſelues from it.</p>
            <p>But in the meane while wee ſee, what controuerſie and diſputation, there is at this day amongeſt men, touching the point or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Churche, that beeing true whiche Lactantius ſaith: to wit, That euery companie of Heretikes ſuppoſeth, that they are true Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Lact. de vera ſapien. ca. <hi>10</hi>

            <p>This Catholike Church is our true mother, yea ſhee is our faithfull and chaſte mother, decked within, with the dignitie and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of her husbande, and not coloured
<pb facs="tcp:3532:6"/> or painted without, with lying and falſhoode: and afterwardes hee addeth: Let vs looke well to our ſelues, that the ſtrange and falſe name of the Churche turne vs not away from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ours, and that the outwarde ſhewe, or borowed bare title of the Churche doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs.</p>
            <p>There are ſome others, who remaine aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as it were, and doubtfull, not knowing to which parte to turne, neither on which ſide to ſet themſelues in order. Seeing the Romiſhe Church armed with great force and authoritie, mainteined and vpholden by great perſonages, cloathed with diuers ornaments, outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, and followed of the greateſt number: On the other ſide, beholding the reformed Church feeble and weake in outwarde ſhewe, made and ſtanding for the moſt part, of the ſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and baſeſt according to the world, ſimple in deckings and ceremonies, and followed of very fewe people.</p>
            <p>But the doctrine of the trueth (which is our principall light, and chiefe guide) giueth vs a good remedie and aide in this difficultie, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vs that the true Churche, ought to bee diſcerned from the falſe, by her owne right and true marks, which are the pure preaching of the
<pb facs="tcp:3532:6"/> worde, and the true and right vſe of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and not the great number of people, nor pompes, not outward ceremonies, inuented &amp; deuiſed by men themſelues.</p>
            <p>You (my Lorde) haue ſometimes ſeene what trouble and combates the very viſarde, bare name, and ſhining ſhewe, of the Romiſhe church hath brought, to ſom mens conſciences and ſpirites, and that not only amongeſt the rudeſt and ignorant ſort but euen in the rancke and order of thoſe, which made profeſſion and tooke vpon them to teach others: yea ſo farre it hath carried them, that by reaſon there was nor in them a full reſoluteneſſe, they knew not of what companie they ſhoulde bee.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding as touching your ſelfe after that God had honoured you with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and called you into his Churche, that you mighte bee comprehended within the ſheepefolde of Ieſus Chriſtes his ſonne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing almoſt made open profeſſion of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; and caſt away the beaſtes marke, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſhaking and ſtaggering you perceiued in diuers others, you notwithſtanding haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued, through Gods grace, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſetling your ſelfe vpon his aſſured and inuincible worde. And in deede, by
<pb facs="tcp:3532:7"/> what force and ſtrength coulde the backe fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges of ſome, &amp; the Sophiſticall diſputations of other ſome, aſtoniſhe your faith, or beate downe your conſtancie, ſo well mainteined and vpholden by the holy Ghoſte? How could theſe aſſaultes cracke your courage, or change and make colde your zeale, ſo hotte in the ſeruice of God? Certainely, this is a great matter that all the worlde hath an eye vpon you, wondering at, and louing, the great and ſingular affection which you beare, to the aduancement of Gods true religion and ſeruice.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion is nowe, to continue in well doing and to proceede dayly from good to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For this is nothing to beginne well, except a man perſeuere and continue euen to the end. And wee knowe what Ieſus Chriſte ſaith, to wit, That hee which putteth his hande to the plough, and looketh backe, is not apte to the kingdome of God.<note place="margin">Luke. 9.62. 2. Tim. 2.5.</note> And Saint Paule. If any man (ſaith hee) ſtriue for a maſtrie, hee is not crowned, except hee ſtriue as hee ought to doe.</p>
            <p>There are ſome whiche ſay, that this is enough, for a man to haue ſome teſtimonie in his conſcience, that hee belongeth to God,
<pb facs="tcp:3532:7"/> albeit hee make not, any declaration or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his religion. But by the teſtimonies heere aboue marked, and put downe, it is eaſie for vs to gather what neede wee haue, to range and bring our ſelues into the true Churche, that wee may therein liue Chriſtianlie in the ſeruice of God, ſeeing that any where els there is neither life nor light. And alſo what aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can they haue of their ſaluation, which liue in this worlde as dogs and ſwine, following the traine and ſteppes of Sardanapalus, or of Epicurus, to eate and drinke, to laugh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, to play and to giue themſelues to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without thinking any whit at all of God, or remembring any religion? Wherefore my Lorde, euen as you haue well and bleſſedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, hauing had right knowledge to diſcern, betweene the true and falſe Churche: ſo it yet reſteth, that you perſeuere and continue yea that yet you proceede and paſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further, to range and bring into order all your houſe in the feare of God, that it may be vnto him a holy and chaſte Churche: in the middeſt whereof hee may take pleaſure to dwell, that thereby hee may bleſſe you, and make you to proſper.</p>

Which ſerueth well to declare, that great lords and Magiſtrates, as well as miniſters, and the reſt of the people, ought with all their mighte and power to imploy themſelues, for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and aduancement of the Churche of God.</p>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.4.

<pb facs="tcp:3532:8"/> mainteining his ſeruice, as well outward as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in cauſing pure doctrine and religion to floriſhe and in keeping the ſtate of the Church, ſafe and ſound and whole in euery parte. For whiche effect and cauſe, they are alſo named in Iſaiah, Nurcing fathers,<note place="margin">Iſaia. 49.23. 1. Tim. 2.24</note> and Nurces of the Church. The Apoſtle writing vnto Timothie, ſheweth vs the ſelfe ſame matter, when after he had exhorted them to pray for the kinges, and for all thoſe which are placed in authoritie, hee addeth as a fitte reaſon and very ſtrong for that purpoſe: That vnder them wee may leade, a quiet and peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſtie: For thereby hee euidently declareth that the Magiſtrates office is, to haue care that the people whiche are committed to them, ſhoulde liue not onely in honeſtie and in peace one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with another, but alſo in all godlines, and feare of God.</p>
            <p>But if the holy ſcripture did not teache vs this, yet wee might in ſome ſort learne it out of prophane authours, that is to ſay, Philoſophers and Heathen lawemakers. For among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, Ariſtotle in his Politikes hath ſaide:<note place="margin">Ariſtot. in Politicis.</note> That Godlineſſe and religion are the matters whiche Magiſtrates ought to eſteeme moſte
<pb facs="tcp:3532:9"/> neceſſarie, for the eſtabliſhment of common weales.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Plato in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</note>And Plato in his Epinomis ſaith alſo: That Princes ſhoulde not at any time bee perſuaded, that there is any thing more profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for mankinde, then that vertue is, which men call pietie and godlineſſe, that is to ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the ſeruice of God.</p>
            <p>And as concerning lawemakers, wee knowe, that they hauing to prouide for neceſſarie thinges, and to make ordinances and decrees therefore, haue alwayes giuen the firſt and moſt honourable place, to pietie, or godlines, and the ſeruice of GOD. And indeede be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they woulde that their lawes ſhoulde be of greater authoritie, and better receiued of their people, as well agreeing with pietie and godlineſſe,<note place="margin">Minos.</note> they haue made them beleeue that their Gods were authours thereof. Minos the Lawemaker of the Cretenſes, gaue them to vnderſtande, that hee was Iupiters familiar friende, and that hee ſpake often to him, to the ende the people might beleeue that hee receiued from him the lawes which hee eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed amongeſt them.<note place="margin">Zoroaſtes.</note> Zoroaſtes, giuing lawes to the Bactrians and Perſians, ſaid that hee receiued them from Oromaſon, whome

            <p>Wherefore this remaineth reſolute, and ſtandeth ſure: that Princes and Magiſtrates, to the end, that they may in good policie and order gouerne their Lordſhips, and frame the maners of their ſubiectes, ought alwayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with pietie and the ſeruice of God, as with the moſt neceſſarie matter, and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which there is no regiment or gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the worlde, which can long ſubſiſt or ſtand.</p>
            <p>And therefore for this cauſe ſpecially is it, that
<pb facs="tcp:3532:10"/> good kinges, princes, and lords are praiſed in the Scripture, as Dauid, Ioſiah, Hezekiah, amongeſt kinges: Ioſeph and Daniell, among the rulers and gouernours of prouinces for kings: Moſes, Iehoſhua, and the Iudges amongſt thoſe, who had the guiding and leading of people whiche were free.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the flatterers of the courte doe villanouſly abuſe and mocke the very Lordes and Princes, when they blow this into their eares, that the cauſe of religion concerneth them nothing at all, and that they ought to bee content with this, that they haue ſome care of politike matters committed vnto them, and charge of their domeſticall and houſholde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and namely of their Horſes, Dogges, Haukes, Foules, &amp;c. For warre, for hunting, hauking, and for their other particular plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, without trauelling and taking any more paine, for all that, or any part thereof, whiche concerneth the good eſtate &amp; affaires of Gods Church.</p>
            <p>Thankes bee to God (my Lorde) that you bee farre otherwiſe inſtructed in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the duetie of Chriſtian lordes and magiſtrates, than that which the courtiers brab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble and prate, not to ſuffer your ſelfe to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted,
<pb facs="tcp:3532:10"/> neither to goe aſtray from that, which the truth hath once taught you. And I hope, yea, I hope it very ſtedfaſtly, that that great god who hath put and placed in you ſo good ſeede, will giue it ſo good an increaſe, that he will be thereby for euer glorified, and that that true, &amp; not counterfet profeſſion of the religion which you haue will bring to paſſe that you ſhall bee more and more loued and honored of good &amp; honeſt people, and feared &amp; reuerenced of the wicked and perſecutors.</p>
            <p>On mine owne parte, that I might bring ſome aide and ſuccour to the faithfull people, to the end that they might learne by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to put a difference betweene the true and falſe Church, &amp; by the ſame meane to reſolue, to keepe and ſtay them ſelues vppon the true Church: and that I might alſo giue ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and plaine order to all, to knowe on which ſide the true Churche is, I haue as diligentlye builded, framed and prepared this preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as it was poſſible for mee, wherein I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of the Churche, and all the points and partes thereof, that I thought meete and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to touch, or could think vpon. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue followed the moſt apt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient order that I coulde chooſe, without confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:3532:11"/> the matters, therin declaring al that, which wee ought to behold and beleeue of the church, touching her eſtate, forme, guiding, &amp; gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For I ſhewe therein, what is the true Church: whiche are her true and infallible markes, which is the true ſucceſſion &amp; calling of Paſtors therin, what is her ſpreading abrode, increaſe of continuance, who is the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: howe ſhee is holy: whether ſhe may erre: what is her power and authoritie: amongeſt whom it is: what be the degrees and orders of her guiders: what is her diſcipline: whether the Miniſterie bee neceſſarie in her: And laſtly I ſpeake, of her perſecutions and afflictions, in which point I am ſomewhat more large then in the reſt, becauſe I knewe that the preſent neede and occaſion required it, to the end I might con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firme and ſtrengthen the faithfull peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences at this time, in which it ſeemeth that the Diuell, the enemie of Gods glorie and our ſaluation, is vnchained and vntyed, and that all the worlde is kindeled with rage and ſet on fire with furie, and conſpired with him furiouſly to ruſhe vpon the poore Church, ſetting out and making a ſhewe againſt it, of all that, that cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie can deuiſe. Wherefore I ſhewe what is the ſtate and condition of the Church on earth, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:3532:11"/> that ſhee hath alwaies had ſuch a vertue of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ſo great conſtancie and courage in the middeſt of the croſſe that tyrants haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left to perſecute her, then that ſhee hath failed and fallen away by their torments: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhee hath abode inuincible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered againſt the vehemencie &amp; violence, of ſo many horrible combates, as ſhee was to ſuſtaine and indure, and out of all them hath brought a famous victorie, and moſt glorious crowne. In ſumme: that the ſonne of God hath alwaies founde place and paſſage in the middeſt of the worlde, notwithſtanding the fires, ſwordes, torments, furies, outcries, and horrible ſcatteringes abrode which were made againſt him.</p>
            <p>As touching the fruite and profit which may come of this little labour, I dare not affirme any thing thereof, except it be in reſpect of you my Lorde, For I doubt not but you take as muche pleaſure to heare mee diſcourſe in writing vpon this matter of the church, as you commonly do, when you heare mee ſpeake, either particularly to your ſelfe, or publikely in the execution of my charge and office. And yet if you regarde that which is mine, without doubt the fruite will be none: but if you conſider the argument,
<pb facs="tcp:3532:12"/> and the large laying out of the matters contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this preſent treatie, I aſſure my ſelfe, that it will not bee altogether vnprofitable, and that they which ſhall reade the ſame, will not repent themſelues thereof.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I ſtaying my ſelfe (my Lorde) vpon your accuſtomed goodnes, through which you diſdaine not, or diſlike any thing, which commeth from your ſeruants, offer and dedicate vnto you this litle booke, moſt humblie beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching you to accept it, and to take it well that it commeth out into light, vnder the inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your name, and to receiue it with ſuch gentleneſſe and curteſie, as you haue been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to loue vertue, and fauour Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and thoſe that make profeſſion thereof. For I hope that (if you receiue and take it well, that your name ſhall procure it more grace and liking, and ſhall get it more authoritie, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it more fauour, amongſt all, becauſe that thinges dedicated to great perſonages, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter receiued of the lower ſort, although the things of themſelues are oftentimes very baſe and of ſmall account and value.

The Church triumphant, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of bleſſed ſpirites, who hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten victory through Ieſus Chriſt, againſt their enemies the diuel, the world, the fleſh, ſinne, death, and hell, triumph at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, on high in heauen, praiſing God, and celebrating the glorie of his name, with all ioyfulneſſe. We haue a goodly deſcription of this Church in the Reuelation.<note place="margin">Reue. 7.9.10</note> Cap. 7.9.10.</p>
               <p>The Church militant, is the aſſemblie of all the faithfull people, who as yet on earth fight, vnder the banner or ſtandard of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt their head, againſt the foreſaide enimies, whoſe armours or weapons are ſet out by S. Paule in the Epheſians.<note place="margin">Eph. 6.13.14. &amp;c.</note> chap. 6. For it is not the Lords will, that ſo long as we are to walke here belowe, we ſhould bee without afflictions, but hee will haue vs to be continually in the battell, and alwayes troubled and tormented through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3532:15"/> of men, yea ſo much the more, by howe much we ſhall earneſtly indeuour to ſerue him in all godlineſſe and holineſſe,<note place="margin">Act. 14.22.</note> this matter alſo being alreadie concluded, that by many tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we muſt enter into the kingdome of God. Wherevnto doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alſo,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.20.16.2. 2. Tim. 3.12.</note> the ſentences of Ieſus Chriſt and <hi>S.</hi> Paul. Ioh. 15, 20. Ioh. 16.2. 2. Tim. 3.12. But hereafter we will ſpeake more largely of the afflictions of the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that the Church is called either Catholike, that is to ſay, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall or generall, being diſperſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout the world, and comprehending vniuerſally, all the faithfull and elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: or elſe particular, whiche is a part of the vniuerſall: for wee vſe to call them particular Churches or congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whiche are limited within a certaine number, and incloſed in certaine places, being, as it is ſaide before, partes and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the vniuerſall: ſuche in former time were the Churches of Corinthus, Rome, Epheſus: &amp; ſuch are at this day, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Fraunce, Germanie, England, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, and other places, of all which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conſiſteth the vniuerſall, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is but one, as anon we ſhall ſee.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3532:16"/>
               <p>The third diſtinction is: that the Church is ſometimes ſaid to be inuiſible, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſible. The inuiſible Churche is ſtreitly and narrowly conſidered, and is the verie ſame which before we called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or vniuerſall, comprehending only the faithfull and elect, in whiche number they alſo are to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that be alredy dead.</p>
               <p>The viſible Church is conſidered more largely, and comprehendeth al them which are called by the preaching of the Goſpell, to be of Chriſtes flock.<note place="margin">Auguſtine. in <hi>Pſal. 64.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine vſeth this diſtinction in his writings. For writing vpon the 64. Pſalm, he ſaith: <hi>that the church which is ſignified by Ieruſalem, tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from Abell, and Babylon from Caine:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding, in his booke of Baptiſme, againſt the Donatiſtes, chap. 16.<note place="margin">Auguſt.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3532:16"/> as to the other, which I ſaid was viſible. But firſt of the Catholike and inuiſible Church.</p>

                  </note> and ſet it out. For behold howe Saint Auguſtine hath ſpoken therof: <hi>All

               </p>
               <p>This Church is called Catholike or vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall for three reaſons. Firſt in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the place, for it is not tyed, to one certaine place, as citie, prouince, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but is diſperſed and ſcattered abrod throughout all the worlde,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.18.</note> euen as Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaide, that hee hath receiued all power, both in heauen and in earth: and as the ſecond Pſalme ſheweth: that <hi>all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and all the endes and coaſtes of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>are by the Father appoynted to his Sonne, for his inheritaunce:</hi> and therefore alſo did Ieſus Chriſte ſende foorth his Diſciples through out all the worlde to preache the Goſpell and to miniſter the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.29.</note> Wherefore Donatus erred, when hee went about to tie the Church to a certaine corner of Affrica onely. The Romiſhe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes alſo doe at this day abuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they indeuour to tie it to Rome alone. For though it were ſo, that the Church of Rome were a true Churche
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3532:18"/> (wherof we will ſpeake in a whole &amp; plaine chapter afterwardes) yet it could not be but a particular Church, &amp; at no hand the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall churche, wherof we ſpeak. They alſo are likewiſe deceiued, who thinke to chaſe and baniſh this Church out of the worlde. For ſeeing that it is vniuerſall, it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want place, but it ſhall alwayes bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, &amp; receiued in ſome quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or corner of the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, it is called Catholike, in conſideration of the perſons, for it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and containeth all the faithful, of what eſtate, ſex, or condition ſoeuer they bee, as S. Paule ſheweth, when hee ſaith, <hi>That there is neither Iewe nor Greeke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galat. 3.28. Colloſ. 3.<hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>bonde nor free, man nor woman, but that all are one in Chriſte Ieſus:</hi> And in the Apocalipſe, this Churche is deſcribed and ſet out in this behalfe, as <hi>a certaine Citie hauing twelue Gates,</hi>

                  <hi>three on the Eaſt ſide, three one the North ſide, three on the South ſide, and three one the Weſt ſide,</hi> And therefore the Iewes are deceiued, when they ſuppoſe that the church, ought to bee reſtrained, to the onely fleſhlye race and linage of Abraham.</p>

For amongeſt all thoſe, which truely beleeue in Chriſt, there is one bodie and one ſpirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one GOD and father of all, which is aboue all, and in all, and through all: and therevppon it is, that Saint Paul ſaith of the whole church,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.4.5. Gal. 3.28.</note> 
                  <hi>That wee are all one in Ieſus Chriſte.</hi> All the particular churches then, whiche conſent in true doctrine, ought to be holden and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, for one onely Churche, ſeeing that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3532:19"/> the Church is but one? Wherevpon Saint Cyprian ſaide: <hi>There is no more but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church, which is ſpreade abroade or ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out farre and wide, as there are manye beames in the Sunne,</hi>

               <p>We ſay alſo that this Church is inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that there is none but God alone who knoweth the ſame: &amp; therefore Ieſus Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.14.</note> 
                  <hi>That he knoweth his ſheepe: and that he knoweth them whome hee hath choſen:</hi> And Saint Paule: <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe whiche are his:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.18.</note> And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues wee beleeue it, as wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt &amp; confeſſe,<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>No no ſaith the Lorde vnto him, I haue reſerued vnto my ſelfe ſeauen thouſande men whiche haue not bowed the knee to Baal,</hi> But let vs marke that wee ſpeake of the bodye of the churche generally, and not of the members thereof particularly.

               <p>Moreouer this churche containeth alſo many perſons, whiche are not yet called vnto the viſible church, euen as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt ſheweth in S. Iohn, when he ſayth:<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>10.</hi>60.</note>

               <p>Furthermore this Churche is knowen by her owne proper markes, which are two, verie principall and ſubſtantiall.

But the true churche hath for her firſt and principall marke, the woorde of GOD purely preached, to the whiche the churche conſenteth, &amp; conformeth her ſelf, as wee prooue it plainely by theſe places of Scripture.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3532:23"/> ſound and lawfull. For indeede in outward ſhewe they would make men beleeue, that theſe two markes are to be found amongeſt the Romiſh Catholikes, but when all ſhall be rightly and duely examined, wee ſhall finde that the true Churche, is not for all that on their ſide.</p>
               <p>For as concerning the worde, it is not preached by them rightly or purely, but (as S. Hilarie ſayth,) <hi>they make a ſenſe vppon the ſcriptures, and take it not out of the ſcripture, and make it as it were a leaden rule, which men commonly call</hi> Regula Lesbia, <hi>applying it to their owne intentes and purpoſes, and not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their owne purpoſes to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this matter, it is needefull for vs to knowe, that all expoſition of holy ſcripture, muſt bee referred to two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall heads or ends, that is to ſay, that it tend to the glory of God, and that it bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable or agreable to the analogy &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith. For touching the firſt, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſayth: <hi>He that ſeeketh the glory of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 7.18.</note> 
                  <hi>is true.</hi> Now without doubt, when the Romiſh Catholikes extol mans free will, &amp; aſcribe vnto man ſome merit for his works, they ſnatch, and as it were by violence, pull away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſome part of the glory which
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3532:23"/> is due vnto him: and ſo by conſequent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſerue them ſelues with certain peeces of the ſcriptures, to proue that whiche they pretend, they can not therein excuſe them ſelues, but that they corrupt and falſifie the ſcriptures, declaring them ſelues hereby right heretikes indeede. For (as S. Ierome ſaith) <hi>Who ſo euer expoundeth the ſcripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then the ſenſe &amp; meaning of the holy Ghoſt requireth,</hi>

               </p>

               <p>As much alſo may we iuſtly ſay in that behalfe of manye other articles which they haue corrupted,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.9.</note> beſides that very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they propound &amp; teach for doctrine mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which are not onely not drawne or taken from the word of God, but which is more, are altogether contrary therto: as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning abſtinence from meats, forbidding of marriage, inuocation of Saints, praier for the dead, adoration or worſhipping of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and images, &amp; many other ſuch like matters. And as concerning the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, it is certaine, that they are not lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by thoſe men, neither yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme and ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, but they adde and ioyne to them in the miniſtration thereof infinite abuſes, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3532:24"/> ſuperſtitions, &amp; do corrupt them, through a certaine kinde of idolatrie, which is dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and full of vngodlines, for (that I may ſpeak nothing of the fiue ſacraments which they haue added of their owne) let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in what puritie, baptiſme and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſupper is adminiſtred amongeſt them.</p>
               <p>Firſt is this a ſmall abuſe, to applie or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter baptiſme to things without ſenſe (as to bells) which was not ordayned but for reaſonable creatures? Is this a ſleight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning therof, to ioyne to this ſacrament, oyle, ſpittle, ſalt, and other ſuch thinges, as though it did not behoue vs to be content with that ſimplicitie, wherein and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Ieſus Chriſt hath commaunded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to adminiſter the ſame?</p>
               <p>And touching the holy ſupper, when they cauſe men to woorſhippe a morſell of breade for Ieſus Chriſt: when they denye to the people the ſigne of wine: when the Prieſt eateth all by himſelfe, ſo that there is not any communion or partaking at all, what is a corruption of the ſacrament, and an ouerthrowing of the ordinance of Ieſus Chriſt, if this be not?</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that theſe matters fall out thus, we are to make this concluſion, to wit
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3532:25"/> that ſeeing it muſt needs be, that the word of God ſhould be purely preached and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the ſacramentes lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, to the ende that men may holde &amp; take them, for right and certaine markes of the true Church, &amp; that we are certaine, and it manifeſtly appeareth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie be found amongeſt the Romiſhe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, it followeth very well, that theſe are not to be attributed to them although they would make men beleeue, that theſe markes doe agree vnto them, and their Church, as well as vnto vs. But we will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute more largely in an other chapter of this matter, to witte, whether the Romiſhe Church be the true church or no?</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3532:25"/> by being not able in the reſt to find any thing to ſay or ſet againſt the doctrin whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we preach, vnleſſe they intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in infinite contradictions and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt abſurdities. But in the firſt place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuccesſion, I demaund what this is whiche they meane there? I ſuppoſe that it is not ſuch a ſucceſſion, as is from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſonne, as it hath beene heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the line and race of Aaron, as to ſay, that he ſhould be a prieſt, that is the ſonne of a prieſt, for ſo they might ouermuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouer and vnfolde the vilanie of their high prieſtes: but that they meane a continuall ſucceſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one an other, euen from the time of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. But where is this to bee ſhewed, that they haue founde, that ſuche a ſucceſſion ſhould ſimplie bee neceſſarie and make a vocation or calling lawfull? Doeth S.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3532:26"/> in a Biſhoppe or Paſtor, to make his vocation ſure, certayne, and lawfull.</p>
               <p>But that we may not ſpeake confuſedly of this point, we muſt diſtinguiſh, betweene the ſucceſſion of perſons, and that which is of the chaire and place: and betweene the ſucceſſion of doctrine and office.</p>
               <p>As concerning the ſucceſſion of doctrin, we ſay, that it is altogether on our ſide, and no whit at all, on the Romiſhe Catholikes ſide, for we make profeſſion to teache, the pure word of God alone, following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Prophetes and Apoſtles, whereas they of the Romiſh Churche, ſtaying them ſelues vpon their inuentions, teache for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the traditions and commandements of men,<note place="margin">Matt 15.9.</note> which thing Ieſus Chriſte expreſly forbiddeth.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3532:27"/> if ſuch continue in their negligence &amp; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe, they ſhould be depoſed.</p>
               <p>There reſteth the ſuccesſion of perſons, or that whiche is of the Churche or place: touching which, firſt wee ſay, that the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctours did not alwayes ayde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with this argument when the were to fight with heretikes: for hauing to deale with ſuche, as did receiue and allowe the worde of God, as well as them ſelues, the diſpute and matter in controuerſie between them being onely in the true interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, they contented them ſelues to alledge ſcripture, expounding places one by an other, euen as Saint Auguſtine ſayth:<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> 
                  <hi>That that which is darke in one, is cleare and manifeſt in an other.</hi> But when they were to reaſon againſt them, that would adde to the holy ſcriptures, as Manichaeus, who woulde, that men ſhoulde receiue his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, whiche hee called fundamentall euen as it were the Goſpell it ſelfe, there and in that reſpect, they ſerued their turne with the argument of ſucceſſion. And yet when they vſed it, it was not either theyr onely or their principall defence. For in the firſt place they ſhewed by the woorde of God, that they were in error, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3532:27"/> added as a good bulwark or meane of reſiſtaunce, the conſent of the Churche witneſſed by a continuall ſucceſſion of all ages and times. Alſo, they helped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therewith as with a verie likely or probable argument, and good inough in the defence of trueth againſt errour, but yet not ſo, as though it had a like force and ſtrength, for the maintenance of errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt trueth it ſelfe. Laſtly, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of heretikes, from whence they came, from whom they deſcended, who were their predeceſſoures &amp;c. they meant not to ſpeake of their vocation or calling, whiche they neuer called into doubte or queſtion (for the greateſt number of them were Biſhoppes, as Neſtorius was Biſhoppe of Conſtantinople, Samoſatenus of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche, all lawfully called, and hauing right and authoritie to teach in the Church) but they meant to ſpeake of their doctrine, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was newe, and not hearde of beefore. Wherefore when they alleadged, or laid ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesſion for them ſelues, they did not ſo muche meane the occupying of the chaire or enioying of the place, as the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conformitie and agreement of the doctrine: whereas on the other ſide, our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3532:28"/> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do not demaund of vs, who were the authours of our doctrine, but inquire of vs touching our vocation and calling, and are contented with this to declare, that their Biſhoppes, are deſcended from all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, but not their doctrine: and yet notwithſtanding they deceiue them ſelues. For neither in the primitiue Church, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther long time after, ſuch Biſhoppes, as bee nowe in the Popedome, had anye place, ſo that a man may ſafely ſay, they are not deſcended from the Apoſtles, nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr true ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>To conclude, we ſay that it is verye cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that ſuch a ſucceſſion of the Paſtours in the primitiue Churche, was of greate weight and importance, becauſe the Paſtors at that time, had not onelye the name and title of Paſtors, but did withall fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exerciſe the Charge and office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But what is at this day the dutie of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and prieſtes of the Church of Rome? Let the moſt ſound iudge thereof. Is the controuerſie in the Church, touching ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to ſome inheritance, to haue the poſſesſion and enioying thereof? No, but rather for men to ſet their hands to worke and labour, as the Apoſtles haue done, to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3532:28"/> watch diligently ouer Chriſtes flocke, and to miniſter vnto it, the foode which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and meete for it. As S. Paule ſayth: <hi>If any man deſire the office of a Biſhop, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth a good or excellent worke:</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Tim. 3.1.</note> ſpeaking vnto biſhops: <hi>Take heede to your ſelues</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and to the whole flocke,</hi>

                  <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the holy Ghoſt hath made you Biſhoppes or ouerſeers, to feede the Church of God.</hi> And S. Peter: <hi>The Elders, which are among you I beſeech, which am alſo an Elder, with them,</hi>

If the Paſtoures, or to ſpeake more rightly they that vſurpe the place of true Paſtoures indeede, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the election, then it appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the Pope alone, to chooſe the Cardinalles, the Biſhoppes and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppes, and to giue the greateſt and the fatteſt benefices: And it belongeth to the Biſhoppes, to chooſe the ſimple or ſingle Prieſtes, and to beſtowe or giue the other inferiour and leſſe benefices.

               <p>Secondarilie, is the people called to

               <p>But perhaps the Romiſhe Catholikes, will not ſo much examine our calling, as that of the firſte reformers and reſtorers of our Churches, and will demaunde of vs, from whome it is, that they receiued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of handes: and finding in theyr owne iudgement, as they ſuppoſe, that they had not any certaine vocation, therevppon they woulde inferre, that then they coulde not chuſe &amp; cal vs to our charges, &amp; ſo by

               <p>The firſt is: that we ought to exerciſe our calling, according to the viſible ſtate of the church, which is either altogether cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rupted or elſe abiding ſafe &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtate of the church abide in her puritie whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is then, when pure doctrine is kepte therein, and the lawfull adminiſtration of Sacramentes, with the right vſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, we ſaye, that an ordinarie calling, that is to ſay, the waye and manner of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Paſtors, preſcribed by the woorde of God, according to whiche wee haue beene called &amp; placed in our charge, ought to bee obſerued &amp; followed. But if the ſtate of the Church, be altogether corrupted, we ſay, that then an extraordinarie vocation hath place, euen according as it ſhall pleaſe God to rayſe vp his ſeruauntes, and to employe them, to reforme the Church, and to bring it to her olde puritie. For God is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bound to ordinary means, which he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth notwithſtanding, when it ſeemeth ſo good vnto himſelfe. And this was practiſed in former time, euen then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ten tribes of Iſrael, were altogether become baſtardes and corrupted, through their idolatries.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3532:37"/> For God did extraordinarily ſtirre vp,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 10.1.9</note> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Eliiah, to reforme them, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to bring them into good order tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his ſeruice: yea I ſay Eliiah, who was not a prieſt, and had not in that reſpect any ſuccesſion.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe we holde and affirme, that God hath dealt in our time, in the choyſe and ſending of ſome of our miniſters, who were inſpired and ſtirred vp by GOD, to ſtreatch out the hande vnto the Churche, which in reſpecte of the outwarde and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate, was wholy almoſt beaten downe and ouerthrowen. And theſe men neyther coulde not ought to looke, to be ſent from, or to be approued by the Pope &amp; his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe intollerable abuſes, and falſe doctrines, they had in charge to reprooue no more, then they that woulde take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to reforme a companie of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who had openly fallen to whoredom, fornication &amp;c. ought to wait to be ſtirred vp or required therevnto, eyther by alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or ſome of them, they pleaſing them ſelues, and being deſirous to continue in their former diſſolution and leudnes.</p>
               <p>Here to alledge, that for the making of an extraordinarie vocation certaine and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3532:37"/> approued, ſome miracles are neceſſarie, or elſe ſome certaine, plaine, and manifeſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, is to no purpoſe at all, or they ſay as much, as if they ſaide nothing. For as concerning places of Scripture, wee are not deſtitute thereof. Ieſus Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Goſpell to the Prieſtes, who did not well and rightly execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in their charges, demaundeth of them, <hi>When the Lord of the vineyard ſhall come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 21.40.41.</note> 
                  <hi>what will he doe to theſe wicked huſbandmen?</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome they anſwere, condemning them ſelues: <hi>He wil cruelly deſtroy theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and will let out his vineyarde vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husbandmen, which ſhall deliuer him the fruites in their ſeaſons.</hi> Now this was in deede iuſtly and faithfully accompliſhed. For the Lorde tooke away his vineyarde, that is to ſay, the gouernment of his Churche from the Prieſtes, Scribes, and Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who did not yeeld him the fruits which did belong vnto him, and committed the ſame vnto other husbandmen, that is, to his Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours, whiche haue yeelded him fruites in their ſeaſons. And euen in like manner hath the Lorde done in the Popedome, beholding euill workemen in his vineyarde, that is to ſay,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3532:38"/> wicked and naughtie Paſtors in his Church, which did not at any hande their duetie and office, he hath not deſtroyed his Churche, but hath chaunged the ſtate and condition thereof, taking away her blinde guides, and giuing vnto her others which ſee clearely.</p>
               <p>It is alſo written in the Apocalips: <hi>The holy citie ſhall they tread vnder foote two and fortie monethes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reu.</hi> 11.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>but I will giue power vnto my two witneſſes and they ſhall prophecie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande, two hundred, and threeſcore dayes.</hi> In which place, S. Iohn foretelleth, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption of the Church, whiche ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt times, yet ſo that withall hee giueth vs to vnderſtande, that God will not ſuffer his ſeruice to continue ſo corrupted and baſtardly, but that he will reforme it, and bring it to her former per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and ſoundneſſe, and that for this purpoſe hee will raiſe and ſtirre vp witneſſes of his owne, to prophecie and ſpeake againſt ſo greeuous a corruption. And howe ſhall this be done? by vſing an extraordinarie maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 9.49.</note>Wee may alſo verie well applie to this purpoſe, the example of him, who caſt out Diuels in the name of Ieſus Chriſt. For the Apoſtles woulde haue hindred him, becauſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3532:38"/> he did not followe Ieſus Chriſte as they did. But Ieſus Chriſte ſayeth vnto them: <hi>Take heede that ye forbid him not, or hinder him, for</hi> (fayth hee) <hi>he that is not againſt vs, is with vs.</hi> It is very true in deede, that ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie vocation, ought not to be lightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, but it is alſo as true, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught not as lightly to be condemne.</p>
               <p>But wee haue a certaine and manifeſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie,<note place="margin">Act. 6.5. &amp; 8.5.</note> of this extraordinarie vocation in Philip. For hee being onely ordayned a Deacon at Hieruſalem, was afterwardes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily called by God to preach Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Beſide, the firſt reſtorers of the Churche of our age or time, who were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called, are not to be reproued or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for raſhneſſe. For as in a citie beſieged by the enemie, or aſſaulted with fire, when they whiche were ordinarily called for the ſafegarde and defence thereof, and to giue order in the daunger of fyre, ſhoulde be themſelues the firſt enemies and putters to of fyre, if it fall out that certaine Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, hauing other charges or offices in the citie, or elſe if they were but priuate and particular perſons, woulde come and ſet vp themſelues, and imploy them ſelues, in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3532:39"/> running to the breach and fire, to the ende that they might preſerue the citie, ſo farre of is it, that they deſerue or ought to be reprehended, as traytors and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſons, that on the other ſide for a facte ſo courteous &amp; gentle, yea ſo profitable to the country, they were greatly to be praiſed, as very good citizens, and true friendes and preſeruers of the countrey: ſo when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſauegardes or keepers of Gods owne houſe, haue declared them ſelues to be enemies thereof, and putters too of fyre, to ouerthrowe and marre all, they that are afterwardes aduaunced and ſet forewardes them ſelues to reſiſt them, and to maintaine the right and eſtate of the ſayde houſe, yea although they haue had no manner of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie vocation, but in their owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, haue onely felt themſelues extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarilye called, for to execute ſuch an office or charge, ſo farre of is it, that eyther they may or ought to be blamed, that contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they deſerue honour and great prayſe.</p>
               <p>And yet this is here to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit all are not inioyned or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to preach, as well as all are commanded to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or ſet them ſelues againſt falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yet by conſequent it followeth verie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3532:39"/> wel, that if any doe aduaunce or ſet forward themſelues, to oppoſe or ſet them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt falſe prophetes, they haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt their vocation or calling.</p>
               <p>Add alſo, that euen thoſe which in the beginning were extraordinarily called, hauing faithfully acquitted and behaued them ſelues in their charges, in preaching the trueth, and being receiued and allowed of the people, that vocation of theirs, which before was extraordinarie, hath ceaſed, yea muſt ceaſe, and afterwards is become ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.</p>
               <p>And as concerning myracles, wee will ſhortly aunſwere thereto. Let the Romiſhe Catholikes ſhewe, what myracles Iſaiah, Amos, Obadiah, Nahum, Zechariah, and many other prophetes did, whom God did extraordinarily ſtirre vp, where they whiche had the order and gouernment in their owne handes, abuſed the ſame. Next, let them conſider,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.39.</note> that it appertayneth to an euill &amp; adulterous generation, to demaund and ſeeke ſignes, as Ieſus Chriſt ſaith. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that miracles may ſeduce and deceiue. For we read, that falſe prophetes, ſeducers,<note place="margin">Deut. 13.1. &amp;c. Mat. 24.24.</note> and deceiuers, haue ſometimes done them, thereby to deceiue men, and to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3532:40"/> their falſe doctrines,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.9.</note> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and ſtrengthen their ſuperſtitions and idolatries. And therefore we ought not by myracles to iudge of the vocation and doctrine, but rather on the other ſide, by the vocation and doctrine wee ought to iudge of myracles and ſignes.</p>
               <p>The other thing whiche wee aunſwere, touching the vocation and calling of our firſt miniſters, is, that wee may verie well ſtoppe the mouthes of the Romiſhe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, if wee would alledge, that thoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters them ſelues for the moſt parte, had in reſpecte of them ſelues an ordinarie voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being in deede called in their time, by the Pope, and by him eſtabliſhed and ſet in their charges, and therefore by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent had authoritie and right, to goe vp into the pulpit, and to teache in the Church, as Luther, Zwinglius, Oecolampadius, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and before them Wickliffe and Iohn Hus. Alſo that in Englande, Sweden, and Denmarke, the right and lawfull ſucceſſion of the chaire or place, is on our ſide. For there the ordinarie Biſhoppes haue receiued the Goſpell, and preache it, ſo that wee ſhall not neede to diſpute of their vocation, no more then for the calling of the Prieſtes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3532:40"/> which are at this preſent in the Romiſhe Chuch, called by the Pope, but euen only of their doctrine.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE muſt not thinke, that the Churche had her beginning, when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles began to preach the Goſpell through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the world, at which time the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, were firſt named chriſtians in Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, but that ſhee began to be in the world, euen from the very time of our firſt parentes Adam and Heuah.

                  <hi>&amp; hath made of one blood al men, that they might ſeeke and ſerue him.</hi> And he himſelfe ſaith in Iſaiah: <hi>This people haue I formed for my ſelfe, they ſhall rehearſe and ſhewe foorth my praiſe.</hi>

But as we haue alreadie ſaide once heretofore, we will hereafter ſpeake more amplie and largely of the Churches force and power in perſecutions. To bee ſhorte: amongeſt ſo manye and ſo diuerſe chaunges, of the kingdomes of this worlde, God alwayes preſerueth his Churche, and bringeth to paſſe, that nothing in all the worlde is dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perpetuall, but ſhee, not that ſhee is alwayes floriſhing, or hath a continuance, which followeth all by one threede, that is, commeth altogether, but becauſe that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3532:42"/> God, not minding that his name ſhould be put out in the worlde, doeth alwayes in his Churche raiſe vp ſome, of whome hee is ſincerely and purely ſerued.</p>

And indeede, on the ſide of the multitude and great number, the falſe and baſtardly Church is rather founde, than the true and lawfull one.

               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding alſo wee may tightly ſaye, that God ſuffereth Sathan to haue ſo much power and might in the worlde, as that he ſhoulde beare ſway &amp; raigne ouer the greater part, to the ende that he might thereby through his iuſt iudgement, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe men for their vnthankefulneſſe and vnfaithfulneſſe. For it is not good reaſon that thoſe which would not hearken vnto God, neither receiue the trueth which was offered them, and who alſo euen willingly and of their owne accorde, haue deſpiſed and refuſed their owne ſaluation, is it not meete I ſay that ſuch ſhould be ſeduced and deceiued through the ſubtilties and ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the diuell, and at the laſt caſt from God, and throughe his iuſt iudgement pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, according as their vngodlineſſe and vnthankefulneſſe deſerueth? Sainte Paule writing vnto the Theſſalonians, ſheweth and putteth downe this reaſon,<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3532:45"/> they might be damned which beleeued not the trueth of the worde, but had pleaſure in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This alſo fell ſometimes, and was laide vpon the Gentiles. For from the beginning of the worlde, GOD made manifeſt vnto them his Godhead and his power,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20. &amp;c.</note> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this was not done by the preaching of men, yet it was by the miniſterie of the creatures, in which his glorie was in ſuche ſorte manifeſted and ſhewed, that a man may well ſay, they had in ſome ſenſe, a ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, as it were to ſhewe, ſet foorth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the great power of the wonderfull workes of God. But what thereof? Theſe ſtraglers &amp; ſtrayers hauing knowne GOD, did not glorifie him as God, neyther yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him thankes, but became vayne in their imaginations and diſcourſes, and ſo foorth, as Saint Paule ſheweth of them in the firſt Chapter to the Romanes. Who will then at this day ſay, that GOD hath done them wrong, when he giueth them ouer to the luſtes of their owne heartes, to filthineſſe, and their owne villanous affections through a ſpirite deſtitute and vnfurniſhed of all iudgement, to commit thinges at no hande conuenient or ſeemely,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3532:46"/> hee puniſhing them after his manner, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſertes, and his owne moſt iuſt righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame fell alſo in time heretofore vpon the poore and miſerable Iewes. For beholde our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, who of his owne free will, preſented and offered him ſelfe vnto them, being willing and readie to inſtructe and teache them, in the doctrine of ſaluation, confirming his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell by excellent myracles and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſignes worthie of credite, by whiche hee did euidently ſhewe vnto them, that hee was the verye Meſſias promiſed in the lawe, and the true and onely redeemer of the worlde, but howe did theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people gouerne and behaue them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in that behalfe? Their obſtinacie and rebellion was ſo greate, that they were not onely content, deſperately to reiecte, and throwe from them, the doctrine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Goſpell, ſlaundering it and accuſing it of falſehoode, but which is worſe, they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and cruelly murdered the onely ſonne of GOD, and outragiouſly perſecuted the Apoſtles (as before that they had put to death alſo euen their owne Prophetes) and other Chriſtians. Who is he then whiche
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3532:46"/> will affirme, that theſe wicked people did not through their rebellion and pride iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerue to bee deliuered and giuen ouer for a praye vnto Sathan, and to be deceiued through the ſubtilties &amp; craftes of his falſe doctrine?</p>
               <p>The ſame is fallen out in our time, and continueth yet, euen euery day. For there are diuers which are in ſuch ſorte blinded, and beefore hande poſſeſſed with the darkeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the prince of this worlde, that they doe not onely deſpiſe all true religion and doctrine, but alſo they inforce and ſtraine them ſelues, to bring into credite and eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imation all the dreames, dotages, raylings, and falſe opinions of Antichriſt, and his inſtrumentes, in ſo much that for to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereto, they ceaſe not to make warre vppon the poore faythfull people, deſiring with a burning affection, the ſheading of their bloude. Who is hee then whiche dare ſay, that ſuch people are not verie woorthie and meete to bee deliuered vnto Sathan, that they may be ſo made drunken with the deadlie poyſon of his falſe doctrine, as they may neuer after be able to taſte or ſmell, the ſweetnes &amp; pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tnes of the word of God? To bee ſhort then, in that the deuill hath ſo

                     <hi>2.</hi> Theſ. 2.3, 4</note> ſhewing him ſelfe as though he were GOD. For from Biſhoppes they came to Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litantes, who alſo are called Archbiſhops, and that vnder goodly ſhewe and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For theſe Metropolitanes, were not, but as it were Preſidentes or rulers, to ſette the other in order, and to call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it was needefull, to haue ſome Synode, for the affaires and buſineſſes of the Churches of the Prouince, and in good order, and without confuſion to redreſſe and guide matters, in the aſſemblyes made.</p>
               <p>From Metropolitanes they leaped to foure Patriarches, as though the whole Chriſtian common wealth, ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into foure partes, and bee ruled and gouerned by foure prelates. Theſe Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches were, one of Antioch, who bare rule ouer Syria: one of Alexandria, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned

Here vpon afterwards there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe contentions and ſtirres, betweene theſe foure Patriarches, touching their iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and primacie, in ſo much that they in ſuch ſorte, ſet them ſelues one of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other, with the hurt and loſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede of the poore Churche, that at the laſt two, to witte, that of Antioche, and that of Alexandria, gaue place and yeelded their roomes to the other two, that is, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople and Rome, the controuerſie bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene which endureth as yet, euen vnto this day. For it is not yet well determined nor made plaine, which of theſe two ought to be head and vniuerſall Biſhoppe. In ſome ſorte to quiet them, and to make them contented, and to keepe them ſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne boundes, men haue limitted their charges thus, the Patriarch of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, to beare rule ouer all the Churches of the Eaſt, and the Patriarch of Rome, to beare rule ouer al the Churches of the Weſt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the latter of theſe two, is hee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3532:48"/> whom the Romiſhe Catholikes make them ſelues to beleeue, that hee is the head of the vniuerſall church, as being the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſte on earth, and the lawfull or ryght ſucceſſour of Saint Peter. But wee haue here two pointes to examine and ſift: the one touching Saint Peter: The other tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Pope, who ſayeth that he is his ſucceſſour.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, wee ſhall not finde in all the ſcriptures, that S. Peter was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at any time to bee head of the whole Church, and to beare rule ouer it, neyther that he him ſelfe did at any time, eyther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende or vſurpe, ſuche a iuriſdiction and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, becauſe it did not at any hande bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him, but vnto Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as wee hope to prooue, and manifeſtly to ſhewe it by the reaſons following.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is this Ieſus Chriſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is called the heade of the Churche. Epheſians 1. verſe 22. Epheſians 5. verſe 23.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.22. Epheſ. 5.23.</note> Saint Peter then is not, otherwiſe the Churche ſhoulde bee a bodye with two heades.</p>
               <p>If they will replie, &amp; ſay, that Ieſus Chriſt in deede is the onely head of the Chuche, becauſe that hee alone raigneth ouer it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3532:49"/> and that by his owne onely authoritie, yet that this nothing hindreth, but that there may be an other head miniſteriall (as they call it) that is to ſay, one in reſpecte of the execution of the charge and office vnder him, who ſhoulde be his great Vicar and liuetenante generall, for to gouerne the Churche, I will demaunde of them to ſhewe mee, when and howe this miniſteriall head, was ordayned by Ieſus Chriſte: for if Ieſus Chriſte be God liuing for euer, what neede hath hee of a ſucceſſour?<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note> If wee haue all his will in writing, and if hee bee alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the middeſt of his Churche,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.15. Act. 20.27. Mat. 18.18.28.<hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> to rule and gouerne the ſame, what hath hee to doe for a Vicar or Liuetenaunt? And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning charges and offices, we knowe what executors he hath eſtabliſhed and left. Saint Paule in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.<hi>11.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt being aſcended into heauen hath giuen ſome Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, ſome Euangeliſtes, ſome paſtours, ſome teachers, to whome hee hath giuen in charge, and committed his Churche to order and guide the ſame.</hi> This is not ſpoken onely, for two or three, or for ſome other ſmall number, neither yet for one age, but for all the Paſtours of the Churche generallie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3532:49"/> and for all times. Nowe you maye ſee what lieutenantes Ieſus Chriſte hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his place: but that hee ſhoulde giue vnto Peter a primacie, to bee Pope and heade of the Churche, is a meere lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 13.11</note> Ieſus Chriſte onely is the foundation of the Churche 1. Corinth. 3.11. Wherevpon it followeth, that the Churche is founded vppon Ieſus Chriſt, and at no hande vppon Saint Peter, and by conſequent that Ieſus Chriſt alone is the heade of the Churche, and not Saint Peter. Touching that which Ieſus Chriſte ſpake vnto Peter: <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this rocke I will builde my Church,</hi> we will an one declare the true and naturall ſenſe thereof.</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon: S. Peters charge and office was limited and ſet within certaine bondes: For S. Paul witneſſeth of himſelfe and Peter thus,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>That he was the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, and Saint Peter of the Iewes:</hi> And ſaith, that this diuiſion was made, by the reuelation and ordinaunce of GOD. It followeth then that Saint Peter was not an vniuerſall Apoſtle, nor a ſoueraigne and high biſhoppe ouer all the Churche: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3532:50"/> Saint Paul ſhoulde haue done yll, in ſo limiting and hedging in as it were, the charge and office of his Apoſtleſhippe, yea, &amp; that eighteene yeares after the death of Ieſus Chriſt. But I woulde wiſhe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholikes, to take ſome better viewe of, and heede to this reaſon. For if their Pope, ſnatche and take vnto himſelfe the primacie, for this reaſon, becauſe hee is Saint Peters ſucceſſour, he muſt then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his primacie or popedome ouer the Iewes and preach vnto them the Goſpell, that he may gaine them and drawe them to Ieſus Chriſt, leauing vnto him whoſoeuer he be, that will take vppon him to be called the ſucceſſour of S. Paul, primacie ouer the Gentiles,</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: One wife hath but onely one husband, which is her head. But the Church is the ſpouſe of Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. 11.2. Ephe. 5.22. Reue. 21.9.</note> 2. Cor. 11.2. Epheſians, 5.22. Reuelat: 21.9. The Church then hath none other but Chriſte alone for her husband and head.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon: It is certaine, that Saint Peter vſed the power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which Ieſus Chriſte gaue him, for otherwiſe hee ſhoulde haue neglected his charge, and hidden his talent in the ground
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3532:50"/> and ſo by conſequent haue diſobeyed his Maiſter, not ſeruing him purely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But ſo it is, hee neuer vſurped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny primacie ouer the other Apoſtles or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Churche, for hee maketh him ſelfe equal, to the other paſtors, naming himſelfe a Paſtor and an Elder with them,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet. 5.</hi>1.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> and hee hath ſaide alſo, that it is not lawfull at any hand for any man, to haue Lordſhippe ouer the Lordes inheritaunces. Then it followeth that he receiued not any primacie or Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe from Ieſus Chriſt, ouer the church of God.</p>
               <p>The ſixth reaſon:<note place="margin">Act. 8.14.</note> Saint Peter was ſent together with Iohn into Samaria by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles. Nowe if hee had beene the head of the churche, and had had rule and authoritie ouer the Apoſtles, it had apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined vnto him to ſende others, and not others to ſende him.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon: If Saint Peter had had the right of primacie, to what ende woulde he haue ſuffered himſelfe, to haue beene reproued by S Paule, and that before the people?<note place="margin">In ſext. decr. de con. cap. Licet. &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. <hi>19.</hi> ca. ſi Roman. in Gloſſa &amp; de conceſ. prae. tit. 8. ca. pro. poſuit &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libi.</note> for this was done euen then when hee both might and ought, to haue ſhewed his authoritie and rule. As at this day, the Pope who ſaith: that hee is aboue
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3532:51"/> right, neither is helde or bound by lawes: that he may preferre through his interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation equitie vnwritten, before lawe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: that wee ought to allowe or diſallowe all that he alloweth or diſalloweth: that he is not ſubiect to any cenſure, hauing all lawe and right in the coffer of his breſte and ſtomacke. Nowe Saint Peter did not alledge any whit or parte of all theſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, but tooke in good woorth Saint Paules cenſure and reproofe, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelfe his companion and fellowe, and one that was ioyned with him and the other Apoſtles in felloweſhippe of office, yea inferiour to the whole bodye and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the admonitions and cenſures of his brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.24. &amp;c.</note>The eight reaſon: So it was, that among the Apoſtles, in the time that our Sauiour Chriſt was bodily conuerſant with them, there was a controuerſie whiche of them ſhoulde bee eſteemed or iudged the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, but Chriſt laboureth to bring them to humilitie, and to take from amongeſt them all ambition, ſaying thus: <hi>The kinges of the nations beare rule, and they which exerciſe authoritie ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are called Gratious lords, but ye ſhall not bee ſo: But let the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3532:51"/> you be as the leaſt, and the chiefeſt as hee that ſerueth:</hi> And afterwardes hee ſetteth himſelfe foorth for an example. <hi>For who is greater, he that ſitteth at Table or he that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is not be that ſitteth at the table? And I am among you, as he that ſerueth: and yee are they which haue continued with mee, in my temptations.</hi> Laſtly he concludeth: <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I appoint vnto you a kingdome, as my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appointed to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are our principall reaſons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Saint Peter was not appointed Lorde ouer the Church, and that hee had no more authoritie or preheminence in it, than the other Apoſtles, his companions and fellowes had, Nowe let vs heare the contrarie reaſons, which the Romiſhe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes make.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: Ieſus Chriſte hath ſaide to Saint Peter, <hi>Thou art Peter,</hi>

               <p>I aunſwere, that the holy ſpirite, is not contrarie to it ſelfe: but hee hath ſpoken plainely to the Corinthians: <hi>That Ieſus Chriſte alone, is the onely foundation of the

And what was this fayth and confeſſion? Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon is:<note place="margin">Mat. 16.19.</note> Ieſus Chriſte hath giuen the keyes vnto Peter, he hath therfore appointed him head of the Church.</p>
               <p>I denie the conſequent. For by the vſe of the keyes is vnderſtood not the rule or ouerſight of the whole Churche, but the power, to binde and looſe, or elſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or not pardon ſinnes, as it is declared, in the 18. Chapter of the Goſpell after Saint Matthewe, and Chap. 20. after S. Iohn.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.18. Iohn. 20.23.</note> Now ſeeing that ſo it is, that power to remitte or to retaine ſinnes was giuen, not vnto Peter onely, but equally vnto all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it followeth well, that the vſe of the keyes was not giuen to Saint Peter alone, but alſo to all his companions &amp; fellowes, &amp; by conſequent, if he were the head of the Church, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of the keyes was giuen, it woulde followe that the Churche had ſo many heads, as it had then Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:3532:53"/>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, Ieſus Chriſte ſpeaketh onely to Peter, It is true indeede. Howe be it by the name of Peter is vnderſtoode the whole Church. For euen as Ieſus Chriſt was willing to heare, what iudgement not onely Peter, but alſo all his fellowes had of him, when he demaunded of them, <hi>But whom ſay ye that I am?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.15.16.</note> And that Peter alone in the name of all anſwered and made this confeſſion, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God:</hi> So on the other ſide Ieſus Chriſt, giuing the power of the Keyes vnto the Churche, addreſſed his ſpeeche vnto Peter alone, although he meant to ſpeake as well vnto all the reſt.<note place="margin">Augu. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han. tract. 50</note> And ſo doeth Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine vnderſtande it: for beholde howe hee ſpeaketh. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſignifieth the whole Churche. For if that in Peter there were not the figure of the Church, Chriſt woulde not haue ſaide vnto him, I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And againe, <hi>when Ieſus Chriſt ſayd vnto Peter, I will giue vnto thee the keyes &amp;c. Hee ment without doubt the whole Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon would be marked, why Ieſus Chriſte, in the perſon of one ſpake vnto all: that is, to the ende hee might comend &amp; ſet out the vnity of the Churche
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3532:53"/> euen as alſo the auncient writers haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and obſerued the ſame.<note place="margin">Cypr. tract. 3 de ſimpli. praelat.</note> S. Cyprian ſaith thus. <hi>Our Lorde in the perſon of one man, hath giuen the keyes vnto all, thereby to denote and ſet out the vnitie of al. The other were the ſame in deede that Peter was, fellowes in equall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in equal power. But Ieſus began with one man, to the ende to ſhewe, that the Churche is, one.</hi> And Auguſtine:<note place="margin">Auguſt. in Iohan. tract. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>So it was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all were asked: Peter alone anſwered him, thou art Chriſt &amp;c. and to him was it ſaid, I wil giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, as though power to bind &amp; looſe had been giuen vnto him alone. But as he anſwered for all, ſo he receiued the keyes together withall, bearing as it were the perſon of vnitie. Wherefore he alone was named for all, becauſe there was vnitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 The third reaſon is:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 21.16.</note> Ieſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Peter aboue all the reſt, yea &amp; that three times, to feed his ſheepe. Hee then did conſtitute and make him an vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and head of all Churches.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that this conſequent is falſe, for there is a very great not onely difference, but contrarietie betwene theſe two, to haue charge to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt, and to haue a moſt high Empire, and vniuerſal rule
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3532:54"/> ouer the whole Church. Beſides, if to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt, bee no other thing, but to miniſter and giue vnto them the ſpiritual food of their ſoules,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. Mark. 16.15</note> by the preaching of the Goſpel, as it is in deede: and ſeeing that it is moſt euident and plaine, that Ieſus Chriſte hath giuen this commiſſion, to al his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles generally, it followeth very well, that he hath not giuen it to Peter alone. And indeed Peter himſelfe doth well confeſſe the ſame,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet. <hi>1.</hi>5. &amp;c.</note> when he exhorteth his fellowe miniſters, to feede the flocke of Chriſt, which is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And Baſil confirmeth the ſame, ſaying: <hi>Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe teacheth vs this, (to wit, that he is the onely head of the Church) who did conſtitute and appoint Peter the paſtor of his Church, after him. For he ſaith, Peter, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thou me? feed my ſheep: &amp; conſequently, he hath giuen this very ſame power to all paſtours and teachers, and hereof this is a certayne ſigne and ſure token, that all binde and looſe without any difference, as well as hee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: S. Peter is diuers times in the ſcripture named the firſt among the Apoſtles. Therefore he was choſen to haue rule aboue the other his fellowes, yea aboue or ouer the whole Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwere firſt, that this argument is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3532:54"/> and vayne, yea worthie to bee moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and hiſſed at. For be it that we confeſſe that S. Peter was the firſt and chiefe as it were amongſt a fewe people, that is to ſay, amongſt the twelue Apoſtles, yet very farre ſet is this, that it ſhoulde therefore followe, that hee was the firſte or chiefeſt ouer all Chriſtians, or that hee did beare rule ouer all the worlde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if becauſe that S. Peter is the firſt named, he is therefore the firſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt among the Apoſtles, wee muſt then ſay by the contrarie, that the virgin Marie is the laſt and leaſt of all women, becauſe in the firſt chapter of the Actes, where alſo S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſet the firſt in the catologue or nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,<note place="margin">Act. 1.13.14.</note> ſhee is ſet the laſt after others. Which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Romiſhe Catholikes will not at any hande ſay or affirme: which if they ſhould, it woulde be founde in deede a very abſurde thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we read in many places, that S. Peter is not named firſt. And S. Paule in the ſeconde Chapter of his Epiſtle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Placeth Iames before him.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> Iames then by this reaſon, ſhoulde haue authoritie ouer Peter, becauſe he is named before him. Beſides in the Councell of Hieruſalem, the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3532:55"/> ſpeach and aduice of Iames which was had, after that peter had giuen his,<note place="margin">Actes. 15.<hi>13</hi> &amp;c.</note> had ſuch weight with it, that al conſented and agreed to his iudgement.</p>
               <p>And this muche concerning the firſte point. Let vs come to the other which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the Pope, who ſayth, that he is Saint Peters ſucceſſor, and ſo by conſequent the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it manifeſtly appeare by that which hath been ſaid heretofore, that Saint Peter was neuer eſtabliſhed head of the Churche, and that hee neuer had any ſuche preheminence and authoritie attributed vnto him, by what title or right can or will the Pope (who ſayth that he is his ſucceſſor) pretende at this day, any ſuche Lordſhippe, rule and authoritie?</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo on the other ſide well marke this. S. Peter dyed (as they ſay) vnder Nero, and there ſucceeded him, Linus, Cletus, and Clemens, in the tyme of S. Iohn, who liued vnder Domitian, and euen vnto Traian his dayes. Nowe if they of the Church of Rome will ſay, that the Popes whiche ſucceeded Saint Peter, were the heads of the church, to whom all the reſt of the Biſhoppes ought to bee ſubiecte, they muſt of neceſsitie be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3532:55"/> to confeſſe, that S. Iohn was ſubiect to Linus, to Cletus, and to Clemens.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if S. Peters ſucceſſors be the heades of the Churche, Clemens who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the third place (as they ſay) was ſo likewiſe. But let vs heare what hee himſelfe ſaith in an Epiſtle, which (as ſome ſay) he writ to Iames Biſhop of Hieruſalem. The title or inſcription is this: Clemens,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>1.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. pag. 135. col. 2.</note> to Iames the Lordes brother, Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, gouernour of the Churche of Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and of all other Churches which by the prouidence of God, are throughout all the worlde. If Clemens were the vniuerſall Biſhop, why did hee ſpoyle him ſelfe of his owne titles, to attribute, aſcribe, and giue the ſame vnto Iames, to whome they did not belong?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, who is hee that hath lifted vp the Pope into this goodly degree of honour? Is it Ieſus Chriſte or his Apoſtles? No in deede: for wee reade, that Bonifaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the thirde of that name Biſhop of Rome, was by the Emperour Phocas ordayned the firſte ſouereigne or chiefe of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and the Church of Rome, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed heade of all the Churches in the world: and this was about the yere of Chriſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3532:56"/> ſixe hundred and foure.</p>
               <p>This Phocas (as the hiſtorie writers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe and record) was a traitor and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful murderer of the Emperor Mauriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us his maſter: for as the ſaid Mauritius at a certaine time, ſhewed him ſelfe ouer ſeuere and rigorous againſt his ſouldiers, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing giuen to debate and contention, choſe Phocas for Emperour, who in Calcedonia immediately cauſed to be cut off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Mauritius his owne heade, his wiues alſo, and his three ſonnes named Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Tiberius, and Conſtantine. But hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his paiment and reward for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For hauing reigned eight yeares, he was at the laſte ſlaine by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the yeare of Chriſt 612. Beholde and marke by whom the primacie of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church was eſtabliſhed, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane byſhoppe made an vniuerſall biſhop, there beeing before, not ſo muche as anye newes of it. For as concerning a certain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or decree which they alledge, by which Conſtantine the greate, a Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, gaue vnto Silueſter the biſhop of Rome (aboute the yeare of Chriſt 317,) ſpirituall domination and gouernement, ouer all the Churches of the whole worlde: alſo the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3532:56"/> iewels and kingly ornaments, yea the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it ſelfe and politike gouernement, ouer all the Weſt partes, it is a writing found and forged for and at their pleaſure, ful of lyings alſo and falſhoods, which may be eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>There are none of all the approued hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers, during certaine ages, which make mention thereof after any ſorte, as <hi>Euſebius, Eutropius, Ruffinus, Socrates, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoretus, Beda, Euagrius, Paulus Diaconus, Zonaras, Nicephorus, Oroſius,</hi> eyther other the like, yea they whiche haue written the liues of the Emperours and Popes, haue not any whitte at all ſpoken thereof. No more haue the auncient Doctours, <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius, Baſilius, Saint Ambroſe, Gregorie Niſſenus, Gregorius Nazianzenus, Optatus Mileuitanus, Saint Auguſtine, Chryſoſtome;</hi> whiche is more, the Biſhops of Rome them ſelues haue not ſaide any thing thereof, no not in Councelles, when they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon them, the care and charge to maintaine their primacie, whiche woulde notwithſtanding haue been a good buckler and ſhield of defence for them.</p>
               <p>If Conſtantine gaue to the Romane Biſhop the primacie ouer Conſtantinople,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3532:57"/> Antioch, Alexandria, Hieruſalem, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, what reaſon had he to ſuffer in the councel of Nice (whereat hee him ſelfe was preſident) that the contrary ſhould there be determined and concluded?<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. Can. 6. &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur tom. <hi>1.</hi> Concil. pag. 342.</note> For in that Councell, it was concluded that the Biſhop of Rome ſhoulde not bee preferred, before the Biſhop of Alexandria, or of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, or of Hieruſalem.</p>
               <p>If the foreſaid Emperour ordained, that the Biſhop of Rome ſhoulde bee helde and taken, for the head of all the Churches of the worlde, wherefore then did Bonifacius demaunde and ſeeke the ſame of Phocas, whereas he ſhoulde rather haue required, to haue kept the ſame to him ſelfe and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which was long before graunted by Conſtantine to his predeceſſors?</p>
               <p>With what conſcience woulde Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine giue vnto Silueſter lordſhippe and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ouer the Churches, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, hee him ſelfe beeing a Chriſtian, and therefore by conſequent knowing very wel, that there was a deſtinction and difference, betweene the office of the Paſtours of the Churche, and the charge and duetie of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates:<note place="margin">Euſebius</note> euen as Euſebius witneſſeth of him that hee was accuſtomed to ſay:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3532:57"/> that the Lorde had giuen and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the inwarde charge of the Churche to the elders &amp; miniſters, but the outwarde to him?</p>
               <p>If wee woulde conſider Silueſter, with what conſcience, alſo coulde hee accepte the ſayde donation or gift, the vſe whereof as he well inough knewe, Ieſus Chriſte had forbidden him?<note place="margin">Luk. 22.25. Mat. 22.21.</note> for hee was not ignorant of this ſentence: <hi>The kinges of the nations beare rule &amp;c. but it ſhall not bee ſo amongeſt you.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Giue vnto Caeſar the thinges whiche are Caeſars.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt hath diſtinguiſhed, the offices of the Magiſtrates, and the charges of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church, Silueſter did very yll, to confounde and iumble them together in his owne perſon. Yea alſo, there is a certaine Canon to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Diſtinct. 96. Can. Quu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad Nico, &amp;c.</note> auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and alledged vnder the name of a Pope, &amp; that theſe offices are diſtinguiſhed by Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If ſo be that Conſtantine gaue the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the weſt partes to Silueſter, they muſt ſay that Silueſter poſſeſſed the ſame, and left it to his ſucceſſors: and that if his ſucceſſors doe not any longer hold it, they muſt ſay, that they haue beene thruſt and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3532:58"/> driuen out of the poſſeſſion thereof. But let them ſhewe, if they can, any matter tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this point in the hiſtories. Verilye ſo far is it, that Silueſter &amp; thoſe which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him euen vnto Hildebrande (who was named Gregorie the ſeuenth, and was created Pope, about the yeare of Chriſte, one thouſande ſeuentie foure) did holde the Empire of the Weſt, that indeede they had not rule or authoritie ouer the Citie of Rome, but did peaceably and quietlye acknowledge the Emperors for their Lords, and were ſubiect to their lawes, neither was there at any time a Pope choſen or created without the authoritie of the Emperour. The change came in, in the time of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide Gregorie, It is about fiue hundred yeres agoe ſince the Popes haue by little &amp; little incroched vpon the Empire, &amp; haue at the laſt brought into their ſubiection the Citie of Rome, and ſince they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe that, there is not paſſed aboue a hundred, threeſcore and nine yeares, or there about.</p>

Peters authoritie or his owne, but onely ſayde, that it ſtoode him in hande, to obſerue the cuſtome of the Elders, whiche were his predeceſſors: neither did hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine Polycarpus to doe the like, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him therefore: and Polycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus on his ſide did not thinke, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any offence, in not conſenting with the biſhop of Rome, in this matter touching

               <p>You ſee teſtimonies in owe, gathered out of the moſt approoued olde Doctours, and ſuch as bee beſt worthie of credite: by which you may eaſily perceiue, that this rule or authoritie ouer all Churches, was not in their time attributed to the Biſhop of Rome, and that the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, had not anye ſuperioritie or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, one of them ouer another, but that they were all aſſociated and vnited toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſome obteyned not, neyther more or leſſe power then otherſome, yea we reade that when the Romiſhe Biſhoppe woulde ſometimes haue vſurped more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, than did appertaine vnto him, other Biſhoppes did ſtronglye and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly reſiſte him, whiche appeareth by the hiſtorie following, that Socrates an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hiſtoriographer writeth, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde booke and fifteenth Chapter: and Sozomenus in his thirde booke and eight Chapter.</p>
               <p>A certaine man named Athanaſius, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3532:61"/> one Paulinus, beeing depoſed from their charges, by the Biſhoppes of Aſia, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and mett together with the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane, would needes complaine to the Biſhop of Rome, who eaſily gaue them let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by which he did place them againe in their firſte offices, and did greeuouſlye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue and chide them, who had put them there from. But the biſhops of Aſia tooke this in ſuch ſorte, that they obteyned of the Councell of Antioch, that letters ſhould be written to Iulius Biſhoppe of Rome, by which there ſhoulde be declared vnto him, that he did attribute and take vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, an authoritie whiche did not at anye hande belong vnto him, and that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee offered greate wronge to other Churches, and other Biſhoppes. And there was added to the letters, that he ſhould no more meddle with them, whome they had depoſed, then they medled with thoſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che were depoſed by the biſhop of Rome, and others whiche were ioyned with him therein. To whiche purpoſe they alledged the example of Nouatus, whiche was as yet verye freſhe and newe. For when this Nouatus was reiected by the biſhoppe of Rome, none of the reſt of the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3532:61"/> and Biſhops of other prouinces, did gainſay the ſame, neither any manner of way intermedled therein.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if that whiche is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and practiſed at this day amongeſt the Romiſhe Catholikes, touching the large iuriſdiction and ſoueraigntie of their Pope, were in force by Gods lawe, as they woulde perſwade the ſimple people thereof, ſhoulde not then al the foreſaid Biſhops, &amp; al others together with their Councelles and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whiche haue not at any time confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Biſhoppe of Rome for their head, be verie greeuouſly cenſured or puniſhed, and woorthie of a verie ſeuere and ſharpe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion?

As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the name Pope, we will ſpeake ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (by gods grace and aide) hereafter in the ninth chapter.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs conſider by what toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and markes, the Pope of Rome ſaith that he is Saint Peters ſucceſſour. It is (ſay the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholikes) becauſe that Saint Peter had his ſeate and chaire in the churche of Rome, being there the Paſtor, and hauing borne rule there a long time: and that after him there came in order, his ſucceſſors the Biſhops of Rome, hauing the ſame authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which he had before.</p>
               <p>But touching the firſt, it is vncertaine, whether S. Peter was Biſhop of Rome or no, at the leaſt, whether he bate rule there and helde the ſeat. They are not able plainely to proue the ſame, neither to approoue it as truth, at what time it was, neither vnder what Emperour, neither how long, becauſe that out of the holy ſcriptures, they are not able to bring,<note place="margin">Cal. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Inſtit. cap. <hi>6.</hi> ſect. 14.</note> ſo muche as one onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable coniecture, but rather the contrarie, as Caluin hath well and ſufficiently declared in his Inſtitutions.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:3532:62"/>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, if S. Peters abode at Rome, hath giuen this autoritie to the Romiſh biſhops, to bee the heads of the Church, and vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Biſhops, from whence commeth it, that the Councels haue limited to all the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes (who were many and diuers) yea euen after that they were brought to foure,<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. Can. <hi>6.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Antioch. Can. 13.</note> their ſeuerall charges; making them Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes, euery one in his owne prouince, the Biſhop of Rome, hauing no more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer others, than others ouer him? For at that time the Biſhop of Rome might very well haue alleadged Saint Peters ſeate, and the other Biſhops and Councels, woulde very well haue confeſſed and allowed the ſame, if it had beene true, and if the ſame could rightly haue giuen the title of prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to the Biſhop of Rome. On the other ſide what an argument is this? Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was Biſhop of Rome, and there ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red martyrdome: therefore it followeth that this Churche is the mother and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of all the reſt, and that the Biſhop thereof is the vniuerſall and generall head of all Chriſtendome. Verily if in this reſpect, the queſtion bee to eſtabliſhe and ſet vp a primacie, it ought rather to bee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at Ieruſalem than at Rome. For Saint
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3532:63"/> Peter preached there,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>2.</hi>14. Act. <hi>2.</hi>12. Act. 4.3</note> yea the firſte after Chriſtes aſcention, where hee together with his fellowes and brethren builded vp the Churche, did great miracles, was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>5.</hi> 18</note> and ſundrie times perſecuted. The Prophetes likewiſe preached there, and all the Apoſtles, yea whiche is more, Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>2.</hi>13. &amp; <hi>7.14.</hi> &amp; 8.2. &amp;c. 18.20</note> died there and roſe againe, and from thence aſcended vp into heauen. There alſo was the firſt Synode, that euer was helde in the Chriſtian Churche, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of all the Apoſtles. There alſo Ieſus Chriſt ſent downe his holy ſpirite vpon his Apoſtles and diſciples.<note place="margin">Act. 15.<hi>6</hi> &amp;c. Act. 2.1. &amp;c</note> And to bee ſhorte, from thence it was that the doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, ſhoulde come forth, to bee ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad throughout all the world, euen as the Prophets had before tolde:<note place="margin">Iſai. 2.3 Michah. 4.2</note> which things we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not after any ſort ſay or affirme of Rome,</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if we muſt reſpect and regarde the Apoſtles, there is as muche, or rather more reaſon, to make Saint Paul the firſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or Pope of Rome, as Saint Peter. For in the firſt place beſides that hee was not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing leſſe or inferior to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or chiefe Apoſtles,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.5</note> wee fynde not that S. Peter did at any time reprooue him in his miniſterie,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.<hi>11</hi>
                  </note> as he reproued or blamed S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3532:63"/> And beſides wee haue a certaine and an aſſured teſtimonie in the holy ſcripture tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Saint Paule,<note place="margin">Act <hi>23.11</hi> Act. 28.30 <hi>31</hi>
                  </note> that he was ſent by God to Rome, there to beare witneſſe of him, &amp; that hee there preached the kingdome of God, two whole yeeres together: that from thence he writ diuers Epiſtles to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that hee was there priſoner, and at the laſt beheaded by Nero. And as touching Peter, wee haue no aſſured teſtimonie that hee went to Rome, or that he tarryed there exerciſing there the miniſterie. If they will replie, that Ieſus Chriſt gaue him the keies of the kingdom of heauen, and that by that meanes, he was preferred before Saint Paul, and made head of the Church, we haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that heretofore, which we mind not heere to repeate.</p>
               <p>Beſides, though it were ſo that S. Peter was ordained to beare rule ouer all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as an Apoſtle, yet it can not thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followe, that his ſucceſſours ought to haue any ſuch right or authoritie as he: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which ſucceeded the Apoſtles, haue not the ſame charge and the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that the Apoſtles had. For when Ieſus Chriſt ordained his twelue Apoſtles, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them for a time only, and after them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3532:64"/> he hath not ſubſtituted or ordained others in their place, to haue ſo ample and large a charge as theirs was: Likewiſe we read not, that the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed other apoſtles in their ſteed, but onely Elders &amp; auncients, that is to ſay, Paſtors and Miniſters, who had their callings, charges, &amp; offices limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore albeit S. Peter might well be an vniuerſall Biſhop, yet ſo it is that thoſe that came after him, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not rightly attribute vnto themſelues ſuch an office. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, by what markes can the pope bragge that he is the ſucceſſor of peter, whoſe office he doth not any maner of way execute, and whom he followeth not in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer?</p>

               <p>WHen wee call the aſſemblie of papiſts the Romiſh Churche, wee meane not that wee hold or take the ſame for the true Church. For we take the worde Church in his generall ſignification, for a companie or fellowſhip, or congregation. And in deede wee holde and affirme, that among the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3532:64"/> the true church is not, but only ſome little tract or path of a Churche, to the ende that that, which S. Paul ſaith, may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, to wit,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that Antechriſt doth ſit as god in the temple of God.</hi> This being true, much leſſe can we ſay: that the aſſembly which is amongeſt the papiſtes, is the Catholike Church: which point we proue by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons following.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon: The true Church is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded or builded, vpon the doctrine of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes and apoſtles, as S. Paul ſaith:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.20.</note> but the papacie or popedome, hath not any ſuche foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe that it hath ouerthrown the doctrine of the prophetes and apoſtles, as may plainly appeare by the examination of their traditions. The popedome therfore is not the true Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: In the true &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like Church, the truth ſhold reigne &amp; beare ſway, for S. Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.7.15.</note> 
                  <hi>the church is the piller and ground of truth:</hi> but in the papacie truth reigneth not, but on the contrarie ſide falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; lying, as appeareth by the doctrine of the maſſe, of Purgatorie, of inuocation or prayer to Saints, of idols, of merites, and other ſuch matters. Wherfore it followeth, that the papacie or popedome is not the true Church.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:3532:65"/>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2 Ephe. 5.22</note>The third reaſon: The true Church, is the ſpouſe or wife of Chriſt: But the Church of Rome is not the ſpouſe of Chriſt. For the ſpouſe of Chriſte contenteth her ſelfe with Chriſt her only husband, euen as an honeſt woman doth content herſelf with her only husband, without admitting or ſuffering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other with or beſides him, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church doth not, becauſe ſhe receiueth the Pope of Rome for her husband, &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him together with Ieſus Chriſt. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that the Romiſh church is not the true church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: The true Churche is the ſheepfold of Ieſus Chriſtes ſheepe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.16</note> But the popedome is not the ſheepfold of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſheepe, for it heareth not the voyce of Chriſt the true paſtor or ſheepheard, but the voice of a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, that is, of the pope, whoſe lawes it followeth, and keepeth more then the lawes of Chriſt. The papacie then, or Popedome is not the ttue Church.</p>
               <p>The fift reaſon: The true Church is the body of Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ephe. <hi>1.</hi>23</note> but the Romiſh Churche is not the body of Chriſt. For the body of Chriſt contenteth it ſelf with Chriſt, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly head thereof, otherwiſe it ſhould be a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with two heads, as we haue declared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3532:65"/> in the ſeuenth chapter: which thing the romiſh church doth not, bicauſe it receiueth &amp; holdeth the pope for her head. Wherfore it foloweth very wel, that the Romiſh church is not the true church.</p>
               <p>The ſixt reaſon: Though it were that the church of Rome were the true Church, yet it could not be but a particular church, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Church of Corinthus, Epheſus, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereupon it foloweth, that it is not, neither can be the Catholike and vniuerſall church.</p>
               <p>The 7. reaſon: In the true Church theſe 3. markes are found without fayling: that is to ſay: the lawful calling of paſtors, the pure preaching of the word, and the right admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſacraments. But in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church, theſe 3. markes are not to bee found, as it is eaſie to ſhew, by the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a man might take thereof. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth, that the Romiſh church is not the true and right church.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſeeing that wee haue ſufficiently ſhewed, that the churche of Rome, is not the Catholike Churche, neither yet the true Churche, men muſt not deeme it ſtraunge, that wee cannot agree with it, but that wee depart and ſeparate our ſelues from it: and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3532:66"/> that in ſo doing, we ought not at any hand, or any maner of way to be held and accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Schiſmatiks, becauſe we do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, the ancient and Catholike Church, no not the auncient Romane Church, but do altogether agree with the ſame. For would wee knowe, what manner of Church, the Church of Rome was in ancient time? Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian teacheth it vs, when he ſpeketh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of after this maner: <hi>A bleſſed Churche, for which the Apoſtles haue ſpread abrode all the doctrine with their blood:</hi>

Shee hath acknowledged, confeſſed, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one onely God the Creator of all things, and Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God, borne of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Mary: ſhee hath beleeued alſo the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the fleſh: ſhee hath receiued the law and the Prophetes, with the writinges as well of the Euangeliſts as of the Apoſtles, and

Wherefore we haue not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken this auncient churche of Rome, but the newe and particular Romiſhe churche, which ſince hath lifted vp her ſelfe, whiche aduoucheth the pope for her head, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him for the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſte on earth, which worſhippeth him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth his lawes againſte the lawes of GOD. For ſhee hath degenerated and gone out of kinde, and hath loſte all her authoritie, euen as the cleargie of the ſaide Church hath ſometimes foretolde, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Saint Cyprian ſaying: <hi>That the prayſe that Saint Paule gaue to that Churche,</hi>

                  <hi>to wit, that their faith was ſpreade abroade, and publiſhed throughout all the woorlde, ſhoulde be turned to their ſhame and diſpraiſe, if they went out of kinde, and became baſtards, and if they continued not to be the heires of the ſame faith.</hi> And by this departure from her, we haue declared the obedience which wee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3532:67"/> owe vnto God, who hath commaunded vs to doe ſo ſaying: <hi>Goe out of Babylon, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, &amp; that ye receiue not of her plagues:</hi> And haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the counſell of S.

               <p>But ſome will ſay: yee account the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches of Germanie for the true church, though ye finde there many things to be amended, as concerning the ſupper it ſelfe, and ſom other ceremonies. Why then make you not the like accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the church of Rome? I anſwere, that it is very true that there is ſome controuerſie betweene the Germaines and vs, touching ſome pointes of religion, but it is not in reſpect of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall or ſubſtantiall pointes thereof. I call them eſſentiall or ſubſtantiall pointes, that are ſo of the ſubſtance of religion that if men erre in one point, the ſame cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or ſtande. For euen in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the holy Supper, wee all beleeue
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3532:67"/> that wee are partakers of the bodye and blood of Chriſte. The difference is not, but in the Conſubſtantiation, whiche they maintaine, which is not of ſuch great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce and weight as tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Romiſh pretendeth: whiche euen in that one point ouerthroweth and vtterlly bringeth to nothing godlines, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng an Idole of bread in the place of the ſonne of GOD: and making of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Creator, and of Chriſte a ſubiect to corruption, raſing from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and turning topſie turnie, as we ſay, that which concerneth the proprietie, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the glory of Ieſus Chriſt his body. All whiche abhominations and idolatries, the Germans that are refourmed, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and ſet them ſelues againſt, as well as wee.</p>
               <p>But if ſome that are willing to make diuorce as it were and ſeperation, betweene the Germanes and vs will alleadge that the foreſaide Germans, haue not the like opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of vs, that wee haue of them, and that they holde and account vs for Heretikes, as may bee ſeene and proued by certaine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which they haue ſet abroad and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: wee anſwere, that the paſſions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3532:68"/> and heates of ſome particuler per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who haue written ſomewhat more freely, then they ſhoulde, ought not ſo to bee regarded and eſteemed, that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon they wyl make a general concluſion of all the reſt, and ſo proue that there is a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betweene all them and vs. For albeit, there bee ſome diuerſitie betweene them and vs in this point touching the Supper, and in ſome certaine ceremonies, yet vnitie doth not therefore ceaſe, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine alwayes amongeſt vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Socrat. lib. 5. cap. 22.</note>Socrates, who writ the Eccleſiaſticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie, ſaith thus: <hi>There is not any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which obſerueth the ſame Ceremonies though it doe receiue and admitte one and the ſelfe doctrine touching Ceremonies.</hi> And in deede they whiche haue the ſame faith, ſometimes differ amongeſt them ſelues, touching ſome ceremonies and obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Irenaeus writing to Victor the Biſhop of Rome,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 26.</note> rehearſeth that there was great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie in the Churches, touching faſting, and the celebration of the feaſt of Eaſter: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he addeth: <hi>Notwithſtanding though there were diuerſitie amongeſt all theſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3532:68"/> ceremonies, yet ſo it was that they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes agree with vs: and the diſcord or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about faſting, did not breake the concord or vnitie of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then following theſe places we affirme, that wee leaue not of to acknowledge the companie of the reformed Germanes for the true Churche, although that we be not in euery point and throughly agreed with them, touching ſome matter conſidered in the ſupper &amp; ſome ceremonies obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them.</p>
               <p>And the rule of charitie teacheth vs this, as Saint Paule hath giuen vs a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof, when he calleth the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and the Galathians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 1.2. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.2:</note> 
                  <hi>Saintes and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones,</hi> and giueth vnto them in generall the name of the churche, although there were amongeſt them great and greeuous faultes, as wel in ignorance, of the doctrine, as in their owne life and maners. This is that alſo which hee hath ſet foorth in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place ſaying: <hi>That all they which holde and keepe the foundation, doe not alwaies build gold and ſiluer and precious ſtones, but hay and ſtubble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome ſay, why folow you not the ſame rule on the behalfe of the church of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:3532:69"/> wee anſwere, that in the ceremonies &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Romiſhe Churche, the puritie of religion is not there obſerued and kept, but the whole ſeruice of God, is amongeſt them corrupted and falſified, and therefore can not without offending God applie or frame our ſelues vnto them. And Saint Auguſtin hath giuen vs this leſſon, teaching vs howe farre wee may communicate in the Ceremonies and ſeruice of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.<note place="margin">Auguſt. ad Ianuarium.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no better rule in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>than a wiſe and ſober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian himſelfe, which will frame himſelf to that cuſtome, which he ſhall ſee vſed in that Church wherein hee liueth. For that which is not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed againſt faith, or againſt good manners, muſt bee helde for indifferent. But the Church alloweth not that, which is againſt faith and good life, yea ſhe diſſembleth it not, neither doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To bee ſhorte then, for ſo much as wee cannot bee preſent, at the ſeruice and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Romiſhe Churche, without defilyng our ſelues in their manifeſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, you may ſee wherefore wee doe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether renounce and forſake the ſame. And in this deede of ours, we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the example of the Prophetes. For
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3532:69"/> in the kingdome of Iſrael in the dayes of Ieroboam, Circumciſion was adminiſtred, and there they offered ſacrifices: yea the lawe was eſteemed there amongſt them as holie, and which is more, GOD him ſelfe was called vpon, and prayed to there: yet notwithſtanding, by reaſon of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and ceremonies, whiche men had deuiſed and ſet vp againſt the ordinance of God, all that ſeruice was reiected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned: neither can any man ſhew, that Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah, or anie other, whether he were a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or of any other calling, did at any time worſhip, or offer vp ſacrifice in Bethell. But ſee more largely touching this matter, in that which M. Caluine hath written there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the fourth booke of his Inſtitutions Chap. 2. ſect. 1.2.3.4.5. &amp;c.<note place="margin">Caluin. lib. 4 Inſtit. cap. 2. ſect. <hi>1.</hi>2.3.<hi>4.</hi>5. &amp;c.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, when wee doe thus ſeparate our ſelues from the Romiſh Church, wee breake not the vnitie of the Churche, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the Romiſh Churche, there is no true vnitie. For firſt of all, it is not at v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in it ſelfe, as appeareth by the ſeuerall ſectes and rules which are amongſt them, one ſaying, I am of the order of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine: an other, I am of Saint Dominick his order: an other, I am of S. Frauncis: an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3532:70"/> I am a Ieſuite, contrarie to that which S. Paul writ to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>1.</hi>11.12.13.</note> in the firſt chapter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Church is not vnited with God, which vnion or vnitie, is neceſſarilie ioyned with the former,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.3</note> as Saint Iohn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth it. And that this is true, that it hath not any vnion or fellowſhip with god, it is ſufficiently plaine by this only reaſon, that hee that hath vnion or fellowſhip with God, ought by the teſtemonie of the holy ſpirit and by faith to be aſſured hereof, that God dwelleth in him, and he in God, euen as the ſcripture teacheth vs. But the faith of papiſts is this, that we muſt alwaies doubt, whether wee be in the grace and fauour of God: wherefore they can not haue vnion or fellowſhip with him. Furthermore, this is to bee marked, that there is no vnion or agreement, betweene the doctrine of papiſts and the worde of God, wherevpon it followeth, that they are not all vnited with him. Which being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, to what end and purpoſe would they haue vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine &amp; abide in the vnitie of the Romiſhe Church, ſeeing there is not in it any vnitie, I meane holy vnitie, and ſuch as agreeth wel to good Chriſtians, and the true members
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3532:70"/> of Ieſus Chirſt?</p>
               <p>They will obiect further: you hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that baptiſme miniſtred in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Churche is true Baptiſme, why then doe you not holde this Church for the true Church? I aunſwere, that this reaſon is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie weake. For wee doe not acknowledge the aſſemblie of heretikes for the true Churche, although wee ceaſe not to allowe the baptiſme miniſtred amongeſt them, for true and profitable, euen as the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Carthage decreed the ſame, becauſe that Baptiſme is alwaies the Baptiſme of Chriſt, and not of heretikes, although it bee miniſtred by heretikes, who haue notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome vocation and allowaunce of the people. Wherein let vs heare Saint Auguſtine.<note place="margin">Augu. lib. <hi>3,</hi> cont. Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. cap. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The water</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ouer whiche the name of God is called vpon, is not baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for neither the creature nor the name is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or baſtardly. Wherefore the Baptiſme of Chriſt being ſanctified and hallowed by the wordes of the Goſpel, is holy among the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and in the adulterous, although they them ſelues be ſhameleſſe and vncleane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in an other place:<note place="margin">Aug cont. Creſcent. lib. 3. cap. <hi>6</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The baptiſme is ſuch, as is he by whoſe vertue it is adminiſtred; and ſuche as bee, by whoſe handes it is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:3532:71"/>

                  </note>Alſo becauſe it is manifeſt, that in what ſo euer place where baptiſme is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, it ought to be but once miniſtred: this is to be marked, that though it be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by heretikes, in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſte, it ought to be reuerently receiued, and at no hand reiterated.</p>
               <p>Wherfore we eſteeme and take the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of the Romiſh Church, for true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, becauſe it is miniſtred, not in the name of the Pope, but in the name of the father, of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſte: and confeſſe that the infants which receiue it, are truly baptiſed, euen as they whiche were circumciſed in the time of Ieroboam and of Caiaphas were helde for true circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed perſons, although at that time the ſtate of the churche was almoſt altogether peruerted and corrupted. But yet this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that albeit we haue receiued bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in the popiſh aſſemblie, and that wee hold the ſame for true baptiſme, yet we are farre off from holding or accounting that aſſemblie for the true Church.</p>
               <p>Caluine hath ſufficiently anſwered this difficultie or doubt, whoſe wordes I will
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3532:71"/> bring in place heere, contenting my ſelfe therewith.<note place="margin">Caluin. lib. 4 Inſtit. cap. 2. ſect. 11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>As in the time of Ieroboam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there were certaine prerogatiues belonging to the Church, which remained amongeſt the Iewes, although at that time the ſeruice of God was very much corrupted: ſo we denie not, but that the Papiſts haue at this day, ſom ſteps and pathes, of the diſſipation or ſcattering of the Church, which through the grace of God haue remained with them. For as Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not be ſo defiled, by the vncleane ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Iewes, but that it was alwaies a ſigne &amp; a ſacrament, of the couenant of God, for which cauſe, god called the infants or children, which were borne of this people his, which could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maner of way belong vnto him, but by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpecial bleſſing and priuiledge. After the ſame maner alſo, becauſe hee hath once placed his couenant in France, in Italie, in Germanie, &amp; other countries, (although that al that was afterwardes oppreſſed by the tyrannie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſte) yet to the ende that his couenant might remaine amongeſt them inuiolable and vnbroken, it hath pleaſed him, that baptiſme ſhoulde there remaine for a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie &amp; witneſſe of that couenant, which bicauſe it is ordained &amp; hallowed by his owne mouth, retaineth and keepeth her owne force, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3532:72"/> the vngodlineſſe of men. Likewiſe hee hath by his prouidence brought to paſſe, that there ſhoulde remaine amongeſt them other remnants alſo, as the Lordes prayer, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creede, the Commaundements of GOD, &amp;c. leaſte the Churche ſhoulde vtterly periſhe. And as ſometimes buildings are pulled downe in ſuch ſort, that the foundations remaine, and ſome ſhewe of the ruines and deſtructions: ſo the Lorde hath not ſuffered, that his Churche ſhoulde be ſo raſed or deſtroyed by Antichriſt, that nothing of the building ſhoulde remaine: And although (that he might take vengeance of the vnthankefulnes of men who deſpiſed his word) he hath ſuffered ſuch a horrible ſhaking and fal to be made, yet it was his pleaſure, that ſome part or portion thereof ſhould remaine, as a ſigne, token &amp; marke, that the whole was not aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore when we refuſe ſimply to graunt vnto the Papiſtes the title of the Church, wee doe not therfore vtterly deeme them, that they haue not any Churches amongeſt them: but we onely reaſon, of the true and right eſtate of the Church: which importeth a fellowſhip, as wel in the doctrine, as in al that which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the profeſſion of our Chriſtianitie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Daniel. 9.27 2. Theſ. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel and S. Paul haue foretold, that Antichriſt ſhall ſit in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3532:72"/> the temple of God. We ſay, that the Pope is the head, of that execrable, abhominable, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed kingdome, at the least he is ſo in the Weſt Churche. Nowe ſeeing it is ſaide, that the ſeat of Antichriſt ſhall bee in the temple of GOD, thereby is meant, that his kingdome ſhall bee ſuche, as ſhall not altogether aboliſh the name, either of Chriſt, or of his church. Hereby ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appeareth, that we denie nor, but that the Churches, ouer whiche hee beareth rule by his tyrannie, remaine Churches ſtill: but wee ſay, that hee hath prophaned them by his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, and ſo poyſoned them by his falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, that there appeareth amongeſt them a picture or image of Babylon, rather than of the holy citie of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To conclude, we ſay that they be Churches, firſt, becauſe that the Lord hath myraculouſly preſerued amongeſt them the remnants of his people, though they be poorely and thinly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad. Secondly, becauſe there remaine amongeſt them ſome markes and rokens of the Church, ſpecially theſe tokens, the power and effectualneſſe whereof cannot be aboliſhed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the craft of the Diuell, neither by the malice of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But on the other ſide, becauſe the markes which we haue principally to regard in this diſpute or queſtion, bee blotted out there,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3532:73"/> we ſay, that there is not amongeſt them, a right ſhewe, and lawfull forme of a Church, neither in any of their particular aſſemblies, neither in the whole body.</hi> And theſe are the woordes of Caluine.</p>
               <p>But though we might in deede accorde and agree to this, that the Romiſh Churche were the true Church, in reſpect of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which it hath, yet there ſhould be no reaſon, to inferre thereupon, that we ought alſo to take and hold it for the true church, in reſpect of the other points of doctrine, for it is moſt manifeſt, that for the moſte parte, they are altogether contrarie to the expreſſed word of God. And as concerning baptiſme, albeit they adde many vaine and ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, miniſtred in a tongue vnknowne to the people, and not vnderſtood of them, yet ſo it is, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſubſtance remaineth, and that which is the principall or chiefe point of the forme, as we haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Nowe if one would demaund: why then ſuffer wee not our infants to be brought to the Romiſh Church, there to bee baptiſed, ſeeing that the baptiſme which is there miniſtred, is good? I aunſwere, that wee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it not, becauſe God hath giuen vs grace
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3532:73"/> to knowe the ſuperſtition and idolatrie, which is there committed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 10.14 <hi>1.</hi> Ioh. 5.21.</note> to whiche wee may not at any hande, ſticke, cleaue or conſent, whatſoeuer appearance and ſhewe of good wee ſuppoſe may come thereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vs or to our children.

                  <hi>That we ought carefully to looke vnto our ſelues, not to doe euill that good may come thereof.</hi> And alſo becauſe that through Gods grace and goodnes, we haue a meane and way opened, to haue our foreſaid chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized in the refourmed Churches, without any abuſe, error, ſuperſtition, or idolatrie.</p>
               <p>They will ſay yet further, that Ieſus Chriſt ceaſed not to approue and allow the Church of Ieruſalem in his time, though it had in it ſtore of errours: which hee well declared, when hee was there preſent at the ſacrifices and feaſtes. Wherefore then doe not wee approue alſo the Romiſhe church, althogh it haue errors in it? For if a church ſhall for ſome abuſes, faultes, or errors, looſe the name of the true Churche, where ſhall wee then finde one alone in the whole worlde?</p>
               <p>I aunſwere firſte, that wee holde not that a true Churche looſeth the name
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3532:74"/> of a true Church, for ſome abuſes or errors therein. For S. Paule left not of to name the faithfull people of Corinthus, the Church, although he blamed and reproued them, for many errors and corruptions, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reſpect of their manners, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their doctrine. And we ſhall ſee hereafter that particuler Churches, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo perfect in this worlde, but that they bee oftentimes ſubiect to error and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray. But wee rightly hold and affirme, that the Romiſh Church, ought to leeſe the name of a true Churche, becauſe ſhee hath degenerated, and gone out of kinde from the auncient and Catholike Churche. For the true, auncient and Catholike Churche, cleaueth to her only heade and husbande Ieſus Chriſt: ſhee beleeueth his worde and followeth him: ſhe is faithfull to him, without committing adulterie with idols, which the Romiſhe churche doeth not, which thing we haue a little while agoe ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as concerning that that Ieſus Chriſt did approue the churche of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem in his time, we ſay in the firſt place, that there is very great difference betweene the eſtate of that church then as it was,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3532:74"/> and the eſtate of the Romiſhe church, ſuch a one as we beholde it at this day. For the abuſe and corruption, as well of doctrine, as of Sacraments, &amp; the manifeſt Idolatry, which beareth ſway at this preſent in the Romiſh church, was not at that time in the church of Ieruſalem. Which is eaſie to proue, becauſe that Ieſus Chriſt, would not haue made much a doe, to beat downe the idols, and to reforme other abuſes, if they had had place there, as hee ouerthrewe the tables of the money changers,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.14.</note> and caſt out of the temple thoſe, that there ſold openly, ſheepe, and Doues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer Ieſus Chriſte woulde not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or diſalowe the churche of Ieruſalem, becauſe that the time was not yet come, wherein hee ſhoulde put an ende vnto the ceremonies of the lawe.<note place="margin">Leuit. 17.3. Deut. <hi>12..</hi>13</note> Wherefore for as much as the faithfull had the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God whereby it was appointed them not to ſearche or ſeeke newe places, to offer their ſacrifices and oblations in, but to come, and to ſtay them ſelues within the Court of the tabernacle, or of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ieſus Chriſte woulde not deſpiſe this place. But wee knowe, that whatſoeuer corruption was there, no faithfull man
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3532:75"/> was inforced to cleaue or ſticke, to any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious manner or cuſtome: whiche is not practiſed at this day in the Churche of Rome. For as all there is full of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and manifeſt idolatrie, ſo they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and inforce the faithfull by fire and ſworde to conſent thereto, and to pollute and defile themſelues therewith, againſt their owne conſciences and Gods expreſſe forbidding.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to what point did Ieſus Chriſte bring the Church of Ieruſalem, when the high Prieſtes, Scribes and Phariſees ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſelues great madde men, not doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duties towardes it? did hee not take his vineyard from theſe husbandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who did not giue him the fruites, which belonged vnto him, and committed the ſame vnto others, that is, to his Apoſtles, and their ſucceſſours, to yeeld him fruite in their ſeaſons? Euen ſo likewiſe hath the Lorde doone therewith in the Popedome. Hee hath not deſtroyed his Churche, but hath only chaunged the eſtate thereof, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it out of the hand and guiding of the Biſhops and Popiſhe Prieſtes, and placing it againe vnder the gouernement and charge of other guiders and leaders, who can ſee
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3532:75"/> more cleerely, and bee of better truſt: as it is ſpoken in Saint Matthewe,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.40</note> vnder the ſimilitude or parable of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
               <p>To conclude: if they aske what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then of our predeceſſours, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith of the Romiſh Churche: are they condemned? I aunſwere, that wee leaue the iudgement thereof vnto GOD: for it belongeth not to vs, to determine and iudge of that which is hidden from vs, and which indeede paſſeth our knowledge and calling. It is very true, that the holy Scripture pronounceth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.18.36</note> that they whiche die without the faith of Chriſt, are damned: and we cannot but ſay amen, and giue our conſent to this. Neither ſerueth it to any purpoſe to alleadge ignoraunce, and to ſay that it excuſeth the ſinner before GOD: For the ſcripture is plaine and manifeſt therein: <hi>The ſeruant</hi> (ſaith Ieſus Chriſte) <hi>that knew his maſters wil,</hi>

Of this ſort are the Doctors &amp; teachers of our age, which teache youth in ſchooles, expounding vnto them the ſcripture. And their office conſiſteth heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, carefully to prouide that ſound doctrine may be kept and publiſhed, to the end that pure religion may continue and remaine in the church. Some ſuppoſe that the office of Paſtor and Doctor is all one, as Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and Saint Auguſtine: yet there is no dout, but that they are two diſtinct offices, which men may not confound and mingle together. For albeit that this be the charge and office of al Paſtors, to teach, yet they go ſomwhat further than the Doctors do. For firſt &amp; formoſt, they preach and exhort, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the doctrine to the neceſſities of the Church: next they adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3532:79"/> and in the third place, they haue the charge, gouernment, and execution of the diſcipline: to which matters, the Doctors charge reacheth not, they being only ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to expounde the ſcriptures, to the end that pure and ſound doctrine may alwayes bee preſerued &amp; maintained in the church. And indeede ſuch a one may be very apt to execute the office of the Doctor, as hath not the gift to preach: &amp; ſuch a one on the other ſide may verye well haue the gifte to preache, as ſhall not at any hande be meete or fit, to exerciſe the charge &amp; office of the Doctor, although that ſometimes hee that ſhall bee the Paſtor, may alſo well bee the Doctor: but yet this is to bee marked, that they are diuers and ſeuerall charges or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>And theſe be the fiue degrees or orders of miniſters, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lorde hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the gouernment of his church to feede the ſame: of which fiue the laſt two onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to bee alwayes vſed in his Churche.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3532:80"/> ſignifie one and the ſelfe ſame thing, as the Apoſtle himſelfe declareth,<note place="margin">Titus. 1.<hi>5</hi>
                  </note> writing to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. For marke what he ſaith: <hi>For this cauſe left I thee in Creete, that thou ſhouldeſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to redreſſe the things that remaine, &amp; that thou ſhouldeſt ordeine Elders, (that is to ſay, Auncients) in euerie citie as I appointed thee.</hi> And afterwardes hee addeth an excellent deſcription of true Elders and Auncients, <hi>For a Biſhop</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>muſt bee vnblameable, as the guider or ſteward of Gods owne houſe:</hi> and ſo foorth. We fee that thoſe whome he named Elders or auncients, in one verſe, hee nameth the ſame Biſhops in an other verſe. Now theſe two names of Biſhop and Elder, and the name alſo of Paſtor, are taken in the ſcripture to ſignifie one and the ſelfe ſame eſtate. For the charge and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Paſtor, is to feede the ſheepe, as appeareth by that which the Lorde ſaith in the foure and thirtie Chapter of Ezechiell. <hi>Woe be to the ſhepheards of Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 34.2</note> 
                  <hi>which feede them ſelues. Should not the ſheepheards feede the flocks?</hi> But the Biſhops and Elders, are called to the ſame thing,<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> as both Saint Paule and Saint Peter doe declare: Saint Paule ſpeaking thus: <hi>Take heede to your ſelues, and to the whole flocke, ouer which the

                  <hi>The Elders which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt you I beſeech, which am alſo an Elder with you, Feede the flocke of Chriſte, whiche is committed vnto you, caryng for it, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If one woulde knowe the reaſon why the Paſtours are called Elders or Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: it is for honours ſake: not as though when in olde time they choſe Paſtours, they were all auncient in age and yeeres, but becauſe that they ſpecially choſe them, from amongeſt the Auncients, and alſo becauſe they ought to bee men both ripe, wiſe, and alſo very well experienced. Old age commonly hath more wiſedome, more experience and grauitie: But yet it doth not alwayes fall out, that white or grey haire maketh men wiſe: yea ſometimes wee ſhall finde young men, which are farre more fit, to exerciſe and execute the charge &amp; office of a Paſtor, (ſuch a one was Timothie) than thoſe that be of greater yeeres.</p>
               <p>It is true, that there are two ſortes of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that is to ſay, Ancients. One ſort haue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3532:81"/> charge and office, to miniſter the worde of God and Sacraments, and to watche ouer the diſcipline and ouer the whole Church. The other are ioyned vnto theſe, to aide them in the exerciſing and execution of diſcipline, without medling any whit at all in the preaching, &amp;c. Saint Paule ſetteth out this order when he ſaith to Timothie, <hi>The elders that rule well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>are worthie of double honour, ſpecially they which labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> For in that he maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bearing rule, hee giueth vs well to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe whom hee nameth Elders or Auncients, that is to ſay, the Paſtors, and ſuch as are ioyned vnto them, are choſen to haue charge and office in the Church, ouer the people. And in that he more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thoſe, whiche miniſter the worde and doctrine, than the other, hee euidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that all haue not one and the ſelfe ſame charge. Wee may beholde this order, euen at this day obſerued in the reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deacons.</note>The Apoſtle maketh mention likewiſe of Deacons, whiche woorde is taken in holie ſcripture in two ſenſes or ſortes. Sometimes generally for euery miniſter, or ſeruitour: In whiche ſenſe S. Paule calleth the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,

Wherefore being ſo taken, and referred to the eſtate &amp; calling of the Paſtor, it is commonly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and turned by this worde, miniſter or ſeruant, as in the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Colloſſians, and the third chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.7. 1.

               <p>The firſt occaſion that was giuen to choſe theſe Deacons in the Church was this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtles, could not very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for or furniſh both the charge of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the woorde, and of diſtributing the goods of the poore.

               <p>Theſe are the degrees of the Churche, or eccleſiaſtical orders, which Ieſus Chriſt him ſelfe ſet vp, and his Apoſtles after him eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, for the regiment and gouernment of the Church: which order was afterwards in the Popedome by litle and litle, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, but vtterly ouerthrowne. For in that tyrannous kingdom, after that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had once craftily ouertaken or ſtolne vppon the doctrine of the Churche, they deuiſed and forged a ſtewardſhip, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation and beſtowing of eccleſiaſticall offices and charges, which was altogether farre off and eſtraunged, from the former ſimplicitie and plainenes, whereof we haue ſpoken. Wherin firſt they made a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (without the warrant of Gods worde) of the orders and degrees of miniſters. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes they deuiſed a certaine kinde of creame or oyle, to annoint them, as they ſay, but in deede it is to greaſe or ſmeare them, fetching that through a falſe zeale, from Aaron, and that which was done in olde time vnder the lawe. And alſo ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or ſhearing, ſpecially of the crowne of the head, againſt the cuſtome both of the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Act. 18.18.</note> and of the primitiue Church. It is true in deede that Saint Paule did once
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3532:82"/> cauſe his heade to bee ſhorne in Cenchrea, after the maner of the Iewes, but it was by reaſon of a vowe which hee had made, and not that hee was then ordeined into ſome miniſterie, but a great while after his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And in that hee cauſed himſelfe to bee ſhorne, he did it not for any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to applye himſelfe thereby to the Iewes, who were as yet very rude, &amp; not wel inſtructed, as he himſelfe proteſteth in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1.

Did Ieſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles? the ſcripture maketh no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof. But let vs diſcourſe a little vppon the fountaine and beginning of theſe goodly degrees, I ſay and meane onely of thoſe, whiche they conteyne vnder the name <hi>Prieſt.</hi> For the others keepe not the place of true Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, as theſe woulde ſeeme to doe.

               <p>As concerning <hi>Chaplaines,</hi> Durandus in his booke called <hi>Rationale diuinorum offic.</hi> alleadgeth two reaſons, to ſhew why prieſts were ſo called. The one is, becauſe the kings of Fraunce in time heretofore, when they went to warre, were wont to carrie
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3532:83"/> with them, Saint Martins cappe or hoode, which they kept vnder a tent, which of the cap kept in it was named <hi>Capella,</hi> that is, Chappel: and the Clerkes or Prieſts, that had the keeping of this Chappell, were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chaplaines,</hi> and afterwardes in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, this name was in ſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries giuen generally to all prieſtes. And theſe little Cabbines, or corners, or rather high places, which were in the popiſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wherein the Chaplaines ſaide their maſſes, were called chappels. The other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that when in olde time there were ſet out an armie, or to doe ſome exploite by ſouldiers, they had in the campe certaine ſpeciall tents, to ſay maſſe in, which tentes were couered ouer with goates ſkines. Now a goate in latine is called <hi>Capra</hi> or <hi>Capella,</hi> that is to ſay, according to the portuiſe of the prieſtes, which are at this day, Chappell. Wherefore becauſe theſe tents were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with goates ſkinnes, they were named Chappelles, and the prieſtes which had the keeping of them, and who did therein ſing their maſſes were called Chaplaines. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde verilie two reaſons, to ſhew from whence this name Chaplaine is taken,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3532:84"/> which reaſons are very high, &amp; full of great ſpeculation or inſight, conteining verie great myſteries, and ſuch as are meruelouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deepe: but we leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee meditated or loked into dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, to the prieſts which are the Popes Chaplaines, to the end that they ſhould aduiſe and take counſell, to ſee whether they can be willing, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende name ſhoulde bee fet and drawen from theſe baſe beginnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Curates.</note>
                  <hi>Curates</hi> haue another fountaine. In old time according to the order eſtabliſhed by Ieſus Chriſt, the Paſtours were ordeined &amp; placed diſtinctly and without confuſion in ſeuerall Churches. For to the end that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Paſtor might knowe his owne charge, and bee able to yeelde a better account of his flocke, and that one ſhoulde not any whit at al incroch vpon, or intermedle with others, alſo to the ende, that the flocke and ſheepe might knowe, where they might ſeeke for and find their owne paſtors, they deuided the people into certaine circuites and countries or rather pariſhes in deede, whereof ſome were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the charge of certaine paſtors, and otherſome to the charge of certaine other Paſtors. From thence came the name Curate, although
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3532:84"/> ſome woulde haue it deriued from <hi>Cura,</hi> that is to ſay, from the care that the paſtors ought to haue ouer their flocks which were giuen &amp; committed vnto them in charge. And the abuſe comming on, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp more &amp; more, they called the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or reuenewe, that was aſſigned them to maintaine themſelues vpon for the doing of their office, by the name of Cure. And from thence it commeth, that when any one goeth about to get ſuche a benefice, they diligently enquire of the value there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that wherof they ſeeme to haue the greateſt regard is to know, how muche the cure is worth.</p>
               <p>As concerning Biſhops and Elders,<note place="margin">Biſhops and elders or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to papiſtes, Prieſtes. Hierom. ad Euagrium.</note> or as they cal them prieſts, we haue before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſeene that theſe two names ſignifie one and the ſelfe ſame office or charge. And S. Ierome in his Epiſtle to Euagrius witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that in the time of the apoſtles, there was no diſtinction or difference betweene theſe two degrees: but afterwardes whiles ſchiſmes were in the church, one was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from among the elders, &amp; placed in the higheſt roome, and called Biſhop, becauſe hee differed from the Elders onely, for the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3532:85"/> executing of order. Nowe by theſe wordes wee may eaſily knowe and gather, that this difference beganne in the Churche about that time, and in that the office of a Biſhop is held and accounted, for a more high, or more excellent office than the office of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or as they terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prieſtes: it was not doone by the inſtitution and ordinance of God, but rather by mans authoritie, &amp; that for the maintenance (as they ſuppoſe) of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Archbiſhop. or Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes.</note>The names of <hi>Archbiſhoppes</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitanes</hi> (which were taken for one and the ſame eſtate) were vnknowen to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and to the olde and auncient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but marke howe they were brought in. Princes hauing put certaine degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their cities and townes, &amp; making a difference betweene ſome of them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of dignities and priuiledges, they called thoſe, which they woulde eſtabliſhe aboue the reſte <hi>Metropolites,</hi> as if you woulde ſay,<note place="margin">Concil.

                  <hi>Mother Cities,</hi> as wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of many hiſtories, and namely and expreſly out of the Councell of Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, where it is ſaide, that they ought not to account any Townes or Cities for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolites, but onely thoſe, to whome
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3532:85"/> Kings and Princes, haue ſhewed and giuen this honour by their Edictes and ſtatutes. Nowe as Princes lifted vp their Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane Cities, to beare rule ouer others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their obedience: ſo the Biſhops placed in thoſe Cities, vſurped iuriſdiction and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer others, they beeing fauoured by their Princes and Magiſtrates, who eaſily accorded and conſented to this, that their Biſhops ſhoulde bee placed in authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others.

                  <note place="margin">Cardinals.</note>Touching <hi>Cardinals,</hi> I know not what we may ſpeake of certaintie, becauſe there is not ſo much a one onely authour, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or writ while the churche was in ſome puritie, that maketh any mention therof at all. Yet we cannot be deceiued, in ſpeaking of that which we finde touching it. We read in Nauclerus,<note place="margin">Nauclerus.</note> that in the time of Pontianus Biſhop of Rome, who was about the yeere of Chriſt 235. there was at Rome 36. Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, Cardinals, that is to ſay, principall and chiefe among the reſt.<note place="margin">Volateran. lib. 22. Antropolo.</note> For as Volateranus ſaith in his Antropologie, the name Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was in old time take to ſignifie as much as principall, &amp; was (ſaith hee) giuen to the Prieſtes, as they call them, and Deacons of the Church of Rome: becauſe that as the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3532:86"/> Biſhop of Rome was held &amp; taken for the principall and chiefe of Biſhops, becauſe he was in the principall citie of the Empire: ſo the Prieſtes (as they call them) and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons of that citie, were helde and taken for Cardinals, that is to ſay, for principall and chiefe among other Prieſtes and Deacons. Whereupon hee addeth ſome examples. There is a certaine Epiſtle (ſaith he) of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the firſt, to them of Peloponezus, who demaunded a Prieſte to miniſter the ſacraments vnto them, wherein he ſaith, we ſend vnto you our beloued ſonne, A Prieſte Cardinall. Alſo: there is amongſt the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charters, in the Church of Aretinum, a donation or gift, of a certaine Romane Senator named Zenobius, which was made vnto the ſaide Churche, in the time of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus the high Biſhoppe, wherin there is contained this ſubſcription: <hi>And I, Io.

                  </note> and to burie the dead, about the yeere of Chriſt 301.</p>
               <p>If the Cardinals of theſe dayes, woulde
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3532:87"/> take their beginning from theſe, let them marke then what is their charge &amp; calling, without taking that vpon them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not vnto them. But we know, what great difference there is betweene their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and theſe, becauſe at this day we may in euery place beholde it to bee an eſtate or calling of honor, &amp; not of office &amp; charge, as it was then. Beſide, when was it, that they were ſo lifted vp? and by whom? A thouſand yeeres and more were ſpent, before that the Church was burdened with ſuch cardinals, as wee haue at this day, hauing benefices, without exerciſing and executing offices. It is affirmed, that Pope Innocentius the 4. of that name, about the yeere of Chriſte 1244. did ſo exalt their eſtate and calling, that he commanded by Edict, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forward, they ſhould go on horſeback, and ſhould weare a red cap or hat, &amp; a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to be, for a ſigne and witneſſe that they ought to be alwaies readie and prepared to ſuffer and ſhed their blood, for the defence of Chriſtian religion. And Paul the ſecond, about the yere 1470. hath ratified the ſame Edict, and in ſome point augmented &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſet vp him ſelfe and ſay,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3532:87"/> that theſe Prieſtes and Deacons of Rome, which were called Cardinals, obtained that name, becauſe at <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> time they were ſuch, as <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Cardinals at this preſent are, that is to ſay, hauing authoritie and iuriſdiction, ouer all other Biſhops and Prieſtes: I aunſwere, that the caſe goeth not ſo. For we find this, that the Prieſtes and Deacons of Rome were in times paſt much leſſe and inferiour to the Biſhops, in ſteede whereof at this day, they goe before them in honour and dignitie. And that ſo it is, we reade that when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, ſent two Embaſſadours or Legates to the councell of Carthage, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one was a Prieſt of the Church of Rome, he was ſet the laſt of all.

                  </hi> in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel which Saint Gregorie held, the Prieſtes of the Church of Rome, were ſet laſt, &amp; made their ſubſcription apart by themſelues, and the Deacons had not ſo much credite, as to ſubſcribe.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>foure Patriarches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Patriarches.</note> we haue ſpoken thereof in the beginning of the 7. Chapter. Now we muſt vnderſtand, that the names of <hi>Patriarch</hi> and <hi>Metropolitane,</hi> were in time heretofore take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for one charge or office, as appeareth by this,<note place="margin">Socrates lib. <hi>5</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> that Socrates the hiſtoriographer, ſpeaketh of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3532:88"/> of Conſtantinople, wherein mention is made of Metropolitanes. Theſe <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> then or <hi>Metropolitanes,</hi> beeing lifted vp in degree of honour, aboue all the reſt of the biſhops, &amp; in proceſſe of time thruſt on foreward with ambition, haue ſo incro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched one of them vpon another, that at the laſt they haue brought all the Patriarches, euen to the number of foure, as wee haue named and deſcribed them in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide ſeuenth chapter. And this hath prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally come to paſſe, becauſe, that either for the antiquitie of the Churches, or for the renowne of the cities, and excellencie alſo of the Biſhops, men haue reuerenced and honoured <hi>Rome, Conſtantinople, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> aboue all other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and by conſequent the biſhops of thoſe places, as thoſe that were the principall or chiefe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Pope.</note>Nowe theſe foure Patriarches, haue yet in ſuch ſort ſo robbed one an other, that the Patriarch of Rome, and hee of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, haue quite and cleane taken away the roome and place of the other two. And as touching the two of Rome &amp; Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, wee knowe what iarre and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there hath been betwixt them, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3532:88"/> is not as yet well compounded or ended. In the time of Gregorie the firſt of that name, about the yere ſixe hundred &amp; two, there was great controuerſie and ſtirre for the primacie of the Church. For Iohn Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Conſtantinople, was declared and publiſhed in a full and ſolemne Synode of the Grecians, vniuerſall Patriarch, and the Emperour Mauritius commanded Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to obey the ſaid Patriarch of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople. But Gregorie woulde not indure or ſuffer this preſumption, that any Biſhop ſhould be an vniuerſal biſhop ouer the reſt: &amp; in his Epiſtles he yeeldeth reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <hi>If hee fall that is called the vniuerſall Biſhop, the whole church falleth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her eſtate.</hi> Secondly: <hi>None of my predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors hath euer deſired to haue or vſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane worde. For if there bee one Patriarch that is called vniuerſal, the name of Patriarch ſhall bee taken from all the reſt. To conſent to this execrable and accurſed name, is no other thing, but to betray the faith, and to deſtroy Chriſtianitie.</hi> Thirdly:<note place="margin">Greg. lib. 7. epiſt. 196.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſpeake freely and boldly, that whoſoeuer calleth him ſelfe vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Biſhop, or deſireth to bee called by that name, the ſame is in his pride the forerunner
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3532:89"/> of Antichriſt, becauſe that by his pride he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth himſelfe before all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This controuerſie being betweene theſe two Patriarches of Rome &amp; of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, it fell out and was agreed, that the Patriarch of Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople, was appointed head of the Churches of the Eaſt, and the Patriarch of Rome head of the Churches of the Weſt: and this latter was afterward ſo eſtabliſhed, and lifted vp by Phocas, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere 604. (as wee haue declared in the ſeuenth Chapter) that he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope and vniuerſall Biſhop of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>And as touching the name pope, it hath bin heretofore generally attributed and giuen to all Biſhops, as may bee proued by theſe teſtimonies. Aurelius Biſhop of Carthage, is called by this name Pope, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the councel holden at the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage: of which councell hee was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. In the hundreth fiftie and one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame chuncell, Innocentius Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Alexandria, is called Pope. Saint Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian in certaine Epiſtles which hee writ to the ſame Biſhop, calleth him Pope. The Elders and Deacons of Rome,<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib <hi>2.</hi> Epiſt. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> called Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian Pope in their Epiſtles. Saint Ierome

If the queſtion be, touching the ſignification of the name, Suidas ſaith, that it ſignifieth in the language of Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, as much as father.

               <p>Nowe let vs returne to our firſt purpoſe and ſpeeche, who is hee that hath ordained theſe orders and eccleſiaſticall degrees? by what dore haue theſe paſtors entred, into the Lordes ſheepefolde? who hath called &amp; placed them in their charges? was Ieſus Chriſte (who is the chiefe ſheepehearde, the Prince of Prophetes, the wiſedome of the father) ſo ill aduiſed, or ſo careleſſe that hee hath not placed ſo many degrees, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Churche, as hee ſawe and knewe to be needefull, for the rule and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, ſeeing hee loued it ſo much, and eſteemed it ſo deare and precious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3532:90"/> himſelfe, that he deliuered himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt cruel and moſt ſhamefull death of all others, to ſaue it? Let theſe reuerende Prelates put downe their authors: Let them ſhew from whence they are come, and from whome it is, that they bee as it were inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, eſtabliſhed, and ſet in the Churche. Let them bringe foorth and alleadge the woorde of GOD if they can, or if they can not, let them leaue off and ceaſe at the leaſt, to ſtrengthen them ſelues ſo muche with their ſucceſſion, and ſo often to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſet againſt vs, their vocation and ſending.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Nowe according to this rule, can the Popes, Cardinals, Byſhops, &amp; other prieſtes of the Romiſhe Church ſaye, that they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie themſelues in their charges, to feede the flocke of Chriſt, to preache the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, to adminiſter the ſacraments, to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſaints, to giue ouer themſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the worke of the miniſterie, to edifie the Churche? How doe they ſatiſfie and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the ordinance and commaundement of Ieſus Chriſt? Howe can they excuſe them ſelues, that they ſhould not be almoſt all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, according to the teſtimonie of Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel and Saint Paule, whereof we ſpake, not long ſithence? what can they ſay or alledge for themſelues, that they ſhould not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated and depoſed, if the canons,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3532:91"/> which they attribute to the Apoſtles (of whiche we ſpake in the fifth Chapter) were well and rightlye obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, as they ſay they ſhoulde bee indeede?</p>
               <p>But behold their vngodlyneſſe: they ſay that they exerciſe and execute their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid offices and charges by their Vicars and deputies, whom they haue ſubſtituted and appointed vnder them in their places ouer their pariſhioners. Yea but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt called &amp; ſent foorth his Apoſtles, did he ſay vnto them, goe and bee the paſtors of my Church, teaching it and feeding, by Vicars, ſubſtituts and lieuetenants, which you ſhal put in your places? It is certaine that hee did not ſo, but he gaue vnto them in their owne perſons, the ſpeciall charge of his Churche, and commaunded them in plaine and expreſſe tearmes, to preach the Goſpell them ſelues, and to adminiſter the Sacramentes. Moreouer what ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Vicars or Deputies are they wont to haue, and howe faithfull, meete and able to doe the duetie of Paſtours? Such Biſhops and perſons, ſuch Vicars and Lieuetenants, that is to ſay, one of them as ignoraunt, fooliſh and vnſkilfull as the other, But why
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3532:92"/> doe they take vppon them the name and charge of an office, which they will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and execute? why take they the hyre wages and reuenue of that labor and work, which at no hand they doe, neither in deed will doe? For they haue no care to haue Vicars and Liefetenants, but that thereby they may enioy prebendes, and the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of their benefices, and yet they will ſeeme to haue them, as though it were to doe their duties.</p>
               <p>Yea which is more then this, they make accurſed and more then profane diuiſion of their offices, betweene them and their Friers, vilanouſly ſeparating that whiche Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte hath ioyned together: For to whome was it, that Ieſus Chriſte commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the office to miniſter the Sacramentes, but euen to them themſelues, and to them alone alſo, whome hee inioyned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to preache the Goſpel? But theſe men, to wit, the Biſhops, parſons, and other Prieſtes, do reſerue vnto themſelues the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the ſacraments, ſuch as they haue, with the rents and reuenewes of their biſhoprickes, parſonages, and other benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and poſt ouer the charge and office of preaching the worde vnto the Friers, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3532:92"/> them the bagge, wallet, and ſtaffe, whatſoeuer by begging they can get for their hyre and wages. But ſeeing that they leaue vnto the friers the office of preaching, why doe they not leaue vnto them alſo the office and charge to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes? For theſe two offices are ioyned together, and may not at any hand be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or ſundred one of them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other. Notwithſtanding, there is in the popedom a plaine prohibition and forbidding, that friers, in as much as they are friers, ſhoulde meddle with or take vppon them to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter any Sacrament, except they bee ſuch as haue charge, or vnleſſe they bee diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall for the doeing of it. But why then are they ſuffered to preach? For this is to doe againſt the ordinaunce and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, and to deuide and ſunder things, which he hath ioyned together. Or ſeeing, that they are come ſo farre, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid friers to adminiſter the ſacraments, why do they ſuffer them to ſay maſſe, ſeeing that they all hold and affirme, that the maſſe, is the Sacrament of the holy ſupper, which for this cauſe alſo they call, <hi>The Sacrament of the altar.</hi>

               <p>Indeed to ſpeake according to the truth,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3532:93"/> making alſo an ende at the length of this matter, theſe men cannot after any maner whatſeouer, vaunt or boaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to be true biſhops &amp; paſtors, ſeeing they are not called by Chriſt to ſuch offices, &amp; that they doe not any maner of way exerciſe duties &amp; charges, according to the ordinaunce and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandememt of the Lord of the harueſt.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that wee haue ſpoken of the diuers degrees of miniſters in the church, &amp; of their charges and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſhall be very meete and requiſite that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, whether the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the worde bee alwaies neceſſarie and needfull in the Church or no. For there are ſome which doe deſpiſe it, and vtterly diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the ſame, as though it were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, vnprofitable, and vaine, whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3532:93"/> and reaſons wee muſt firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and afterwards we will alleadge and bring foorth our reaſons and warrantes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>Their firſt argument is this: The holy Ghoſt is our inward doctor,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. <hi>1.</hi>20 Iohn. 16.13.</note> who teacheth vs all thinges, and leadeth or bringeth vs to the knowledge of all truth: It followeth then, that we haue not any need of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miniſterie, neither that any doe teach vs with the liuely or liuing voice.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere that the conſequent is falſe, and that the argument is captious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical, by reaſon of the inſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring or reckoning of cauſes. For there are three very right cauſes, by which wee are guided and ledde to the knowledge of the truth. The firſt is the holy ghoſt: the ſecond is, the outward miniſterie of the worde: The third is our wil, (but yet regenerated) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with theſe two. Now of theſe three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or means we are not to deſpiſe any one, ſeeing that God by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil accompliſh and bring to paſſe, his owne worke in vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although it he the proper and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar office of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> holy ſpirit, to lighten vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and to lead vs to the knowledge of the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3532:94"/> truth, yet ſo it is notwitſtanding, that the outward miniſterie of the worde is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, becauſe that god vſeth the ſame as an inferiour or ſecondary meane, for the aboue named effect and purpoſe. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the preaching of the worde, and the adminiſtration of Sacramentes, doe then ſhew and bring foorth their effect &amp; power, when the holy ghoſt ioyneth his withall, by the which only the eares are pearced, the harts opened, the affections touched, and the wils diſpoſed and prepared, thereby to giue an entrance to the outward miniſtery: inſomuch that if this inward maſter or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher do faile vs, the outward miniſterie can no more profite our ſoules, than the light of the Sunne helpeth blind eyes, or than a voyce which ſoundeth lowd, profiteth deaf eares. In the meane while, the outward mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie is not vnprofitable or vaine, when the operation of the holy Ghoſte is ioyned therwith, working within, but is full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, efficacie and power, euen as it pleaſeth God to bleſſe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument is. Thoſe which knowe all things, and haue not neede that any ſhould teach them, haue nothing to do with the outward miniſterie: but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3532:94"/> know all thinges (as S. Iohn ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.20.27.</note>) and haue no neede that any ſhould teach them. It followeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the faithfull haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the outward miniſterie.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that the place of S. Iohn, is very yll &amp; peruerſly applyed. For when he ſaith, <hi>that the faithfull</hi> (to whome hee writ) <hi>knewe all things,</hi> firſt this ought to bee referred to that which hee had before ſaide, in the 14. verſe. to wit,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn. 2.</hi>14.</note> 
                  <hi>that they knew the father</hi> (for he that knoweth the father, certainely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, becauſe the father is knowne in his ſonne) <hi>in whome are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.3.</note> as ſaith Saint Paul. And therefore alſo the ſame Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>that he eſteemed not to know any thing among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly when he ſaith, <hi>that they knew all things,</hi> it is as if he had ſaide, that they were not yong ſchollers, rude, &amp; ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert &amp; well ſkilled in the matters, which he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; ſet forth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and that therfore he did not ſet out theſe pointes to them, as though they were altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he did onely bring theſe things to their minds, that they might reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them. As S. Peter writeth vnto the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3532:95"/> faithful.<note place="margin">2. Pet. <hi>1.</hi>12.</note> 
                  <hi>I Will not bee negligent</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to put you alwayes in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of theſe things, though that ye haue knowledge, and be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the preſent truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, when he ſaith, <hi>that they had no need that any ſhoulde teache them,</hi> this ought not to be read alone by it ſelfe, but ought to be ioyned with that which followeth, to wit,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.<hi>27</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but as the ſame annointing teacheth you of all things, &amp; it is true, and is not lying:</hi> As if he would ſay: you haue been taught of the holy ghoſt, who is alwaies true, and no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of way a lyar. You then haue not neede, that any ſhould teach you ſome other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they are wont to doe which teach for doctrine mans inuentions, but if any doe teach you, that he folow that which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt hath taught you, in whoſe doctrine it behoueth you alwaies to abide.</p>
               <p>The third argument: the Lord ſaith thus. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more euery man his neighbour,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 31.34.</note> 
                  <hi>and euery man his brother, ſaying, Knowe the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leaſt of them vnto the greateſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> This promiſe muſt be referred to the ſtate of the Church vnder the new Teſtament: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that the miniſterie of the worde, ought not any more to haue place
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3532:95"/> now in the church. I anſwere, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the place of Ieremie, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the meaning, intent, and purpoſe of the holy ghoſt. For firſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the Lord making co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon betweene the olde people and the new, meaneth not any other thing, but that vnder the Goſpell he woulde ſende vnto his people ſo great a light, by the means of Ieſus chriſt his ſonne, that his knowledge ſhould bee common &amp; familiar to all, wheras vnder the law, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and declared himſelfe darkely, and that vnder certaine ſhadowes &amp; figures. As indeed the ancient people, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> is to ſay, they which were in the time of the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were not ſo familiarly, plainely, and perfectly taught, as we be at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon whereof alſo the Prophet Malachie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>the ſonne of righteouſneſſe,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> ſignifiyng therby, that the fathers vnder the law, had indeed ſom light, but yet not ſuch a light as we, through his goodnes haue at this day. Furthermore we muſt mark <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the lord doth not ſay ſimplie: <hi>They ſhall teache no more euery man his neighbour, &amp; euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his brother,</hi> but he addeth, ſaying: <hi>Know the Lord.</hi> By which reſtriction, or reſtraining it into a narrow roome, he plainly declareth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3532:96"/> that hee promiſeth to his children ſuche a knowledge, that they ſhall not be any more learners of the A.B.C. neither young ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the doctrine of ſaluation. For theſe words. <hi>Know the Lord,</hi> denote &amp; point out the firſt rudiments or inſtructions of faith, and of the heauenly doctrine. And indeed, if we well weigh &amp; marke, how rude, groſſe and ignorant the old fathers were, we ſhall find that they were as it were, litle children, euen as S.

For this cauſe Ieſus Chriſte ſaid:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.16.17. Luke. 10.23 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee, &amp; your eares for they heare. For verily I ſay vnto you, that many Kings, Prophetes, &amp; righteous men, haue deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, &amp; haue not ſeene them: and to heare thoſe things which you heare, and haue not heard them.</hi> In ſumme the Lorde promiſeth heere, that his people ſhall not be founde ſo groſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, vnder the newe conuenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhall haue need of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and beginnings of chriſtian doctrin. But if wee would not take this place in this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3532:96"/> ſenſe, how ſhall wee expound an other of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah, which ſeemeth to be contrary to this? He ſaith: <hi>It ſhall bee in the laſt dayes,</hi>

Now one of them ſaith: <hi>Euerie one ſhall not teach his neighbour, for they ſhall all knowe the Lorde:</hi> The other ſaith: <hi>The people ſhall runne together and ſay: Come, Let vs goe vp to the mountaines of the Lorde, and hee ſhall teach vs his wayes.</hi> Howe ſhall wee make theſe two places agree, ſeeing that both of them propheſie of one and the ſelf ſame thing? Verily Ieremiah meaneth, that the people of God ſhall be in ſuch ſort ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened vnder the newe Teſtament, by the light of the Goſpell, that they ſhall haue no more neede of the rudimentes or firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of religion, neither to bee ſo taught as the olde people were, by the

And as touching Iſaiah, he meaneth that vnder the ſame Newe Teſtament, the people ſhall (though they be wel aduanced and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the points of Chriſtian doctrine) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diligently indeuour, more &amp; more to aduaunce themſelues, &amp; grow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward therein, &amp; that for that purpoſe, they ſhall continually exhort one another, to the end they may better profit in the knowlege of the law.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ioel. 2.28.<hi>49.</hi>
                  </note>The fourth argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. It is written in Ioel: <hi>At that time,</hi> (that is to ſay, in the time of the new Teſtament) <hi>I will poure out my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite vpon all fleſh, ſaith the Lord, &amp; your ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes &amp; your daughters ſhall propheſie, your old men ſhall dreame dreames, &amp; your young men ſhall ſee viſions: And alſo at that time I will powre our my ſpirite vppon the ſeruants, &amp; vpon the maides.</hi> Nowe by this promiſe, the charge &amp; office to teach, is without any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce laid vpon al, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fathers &amp; children, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonnes &amp; vpon daughters, vpon old folke, &amp; vpon young, vpon ſeruants &amp; maides: wherefore it foloweth, that the miniſtery of the word, is not neceſſarie in the Church.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere, that there is nothing in this argument or reaſon, but a meete cauil. It is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3532:97"/> true, that this propheſie ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the kingdom and comming of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that the gift of propheſying ſhold then be common, both to men &amp; women, to old &amp; young, &amp; to be ſhort to all eſtates. But in the firſt place this is to bee marked, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the prophet ſpeaketh heere by compariſon, vſing a figure commonly called <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> that is to ſay, a maner of ſpeehe very exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, becauſe of our weariſomnes, ſlackneſſe and negligence, for hee doth not preſently promiſe, that al vnder the Goſpel, from the firſt to the laſt, ſhalbe partakers of this gift, but in reſpect of the olde people vnder the lawe. For if wee compare, the eſtate and condition of the olde Churche, with the ſingular treaſures, which God hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, and giuen vnto his people, after the manifeſtation and reuealing of Ieſus Chriſte, wee ſhall finde, that in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time, the Lorde hath ſpreade abroad, and powred out the giftes of his ſpirite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon all fleſhe, that is to ſay, almoſt vppon all men, when as vnder the lawe, a very ſmall number was partakers therof. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſaith, <hi>That the Lord will powre out his ſpirite vpon all fleſhe,</hi> this particle or worde <hi>all,</hi> is not heere taken in his proper
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3532:98"/> ſignification, as though it were ſimplie and altogether vniuerſall, but is indefinite, and muſt bee referred to all eſtates and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people, and not to euery ſingular perſon: as in this ſentence of S. Paule, where it is ſaide:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> 
                  <hi>that God will haue all men to bee ſaued,</hi> that is to ſay, all perſons, of what qualitie, and condition ſoeuer they be. And in that place of Saint Matthewe, where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt being in Galilee healed all ſickneſſe, and all diſeaſes among the people:</hi> That is to ſaye, all ſortes of ſickeneſſes and diſeaſes. And indeede Saint Peter, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Chapter of the Actes,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>2.</hi>16.17</note> maketh this ſenſe manifeſt and plaine vnto vs, when hee ſaith, <hi>that this propheſie was then accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed when Ieſus Chriſt ſent his holy ſpirite, vpon the Apoſtles.</hi> Nowe we knowe that all fleſhe, that is to ſay all men, were not at that time indued, with the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly. The Prophet ſpeaketh not heere, of the publike office and charge to teache, but of the particular dutie of euery one, calling them generally Prophets, who in the time of the Goſpell ſhoulde bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed, with ſo great light of doctrine, that they might after a ſort bee compared
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3532:98"/> with the auncient prophetes. Whereunto alſo muſt bee referred the place of Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,<note place="margin">Iere. 31.<hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> which wee haue expounded in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argument,<note place="margin">Mala. 4.2. Mat. 13.16.17.</note> and likewiſe the place of Malachie and of Ieſus Chriſte in the 13. of Saint Matthewe. It is not then without cauſe, that Ioel attributeth, this tytle or name of Prophete, to them, who haue no publike charge or office to teache, but are onely inlightened by the holy ſpirite, and the preaching of the Goſpell: becauſe that this light is farre more excellent, then the gift of Propheſie it ſelfe was in diuers who liued vnder the lawe.<note place="margin">1. Theſ. <hi>5.</hi>11</note> And alſo though wee are bounde, to exhorte one another, and to teach one another in the doctrine of godlineſſe, and the feare of God, yet for all that the publike miniſterie of the worde, is not ſuperfluous or vaine in the Churche. For the ſelfe ſame God, that hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fathers, to inſtruct their children, and all vs to admoniſhe one an other, hath alſo ordeyned the publike miniſterie of the worde in the Church, that it may bee there practiſed and exerciſed, not for ſome fewe yeeres onely, but euen vnto the ende of the worlde.</p>
               <p>And thus muche touching the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3532:99"/> of the aduerſaries and ſuch as ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues aga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inſt the miniſterie of the Church. Nowe let vs bring foorth our reaſons to proue the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is: Ieſus Chriſte hath commaunded that the Goſpel ſhould bee preached, and the Sacraments adminiſtred in the Church vnto the ende of the worlde. Then it followeth, that the miniſterie is alwayes requiſite and neceſſarie in the Church. I proue the Antecedent or former propoſition by theſe wordes of Chriſt, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the laſt Chapter of Saint Matthewe: <hi>Go and teach all nations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>baptiſing them, in the name of the father, and of the ſonne, and of the holy ghoſt, teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obſerue whatſoeuer I haue commaunded you, and behold I am with you vnto the worldes ende.</hi> For after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to preache the worde and to adminiſter Baptiſme (vnder which Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other alſo of the holy Supper is conteyned) becauſe the Diſciples might doubt or feare their charge, as being great in labour, and harde to execute, Ieſus Chriſt addeth a promiſe of his aſſiſtaunce not for tenne or twentie yeeres onely, but for alwayes, euen vnto the ende of the worlde. Wherein hee manifeſtly ſetteth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3532:99"/> out and declareth two thinges. One, that hee willeth and ordeineth, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie bee exerciſed in the Churche, not for one age onely, but continually vnto <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation and end of all thinges. The other is, that hee promiſeth, that although Satan ſubtillie deuiſe &amp; inuent and practiſe all that hee can, to hinder the miniſterie &amp; the work of Gods ſeruants, and the tyrants by their practiſes and violences, inforce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, to the vttermoſt of their power, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, &amp; to bring to naught the church of God, yet hee will by his godly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly power, alwayes maintaine his truth in the worlde, and preſerue his Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the miniſterie and labour of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſtors.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde reaſon:<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.17.</note> The Apoſtle Saint Paul ſaith to the Romanes, <hi>That faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by hearing, and hearing by the worde of God.</hi> Whereby he declareth, that God hath accuſtomed to plant faith in our heartes by the preaching of his worde. It is true, that the power of God is not tyed to this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde meane, but that hee is able to beget faith in vs after ſome other faſhion, and by ſome other meane (although it be to vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible) euen as it ſhall pleaſe him

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:3532:102"/> ſelfe: but notwithſtanding all this, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of his word, is the ordinary meane, which hee vſeth or ſerueth himſelfe with, to giue vs faith by, ſo that they which will haue faith, without the preaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the worde, doe as much as though they woulde liue, without meates &amp; drinks which God hath ordeined for our bodilie life. Now hereupon we take and frame our argument thus.</p>
               <p>Faith is in all times, and alwaies neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for men.</p>
               <p>But faith is giuen vnto men from God, by the miniſterie of the worde.</p>
               <p>Therefore it followeth, that the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the worde, is in all times, and alwaies neceſſarie for men.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: It is certaine, that for as much as the Sacraments are ordeined by God, to bee as it were ſeales of the worde, to ſeale in our heartes that which is therein conteined alreadie, that is to ſay the vnion, fellowſhip, and partaking, which wee haue in Ieſus Chriſte, it followeth, that where there is not the worde of God preached, there wee cannot haue any Sacrament. For as a ſeale is altogether vnprofitable, yea is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3532:102"/> not allowed a ſeale, vnleſſe bee bound or ſet to ſome inſtrument or writing, for the confirmation thereof: euen ſo the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is altogether vnprofitable, yea indeed is not a Sacrament, if it be not ioyned with the worde of God preached, to confirme the ſame vnto vs. Whereupon Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine hath ſometimes ſaide:<note place="margin">Augu. ſup. Iohan. Hom. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the word bee ioyned to the Sacrament, and there ſhalbe made a Sacrament.</hi> Of what worde ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hee? verilie not of a worde mumbled vp, murmured or whiſpered without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ouer the Elements, but of the worde of God preached to the faithfull, &amp; receiued of them through faith, as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maketh it plaine, wlien ſpeaking of baptiſme, he addeth, <hi>this is the word of faith which we preach, by which baptiſme is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and hallowed,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>to haue power to make cleane.</hi> Now from that which is aboue ſaid, we reaſon after this manner.</p>
               <p>The adminiſtration of the holy Supper, is alwayes neceſſarie in the Church, euen vnto the end of the worlde, for Ieſus Chriſt hath commanded vs to celebrate it, and by that meanes to preach or ſhewe foorth his death vntill his comming againe.</p>
               <p>But the adminiſtration of the ſupper can
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3532:103"/> not bee performed without the miniſterie of the worde.</p>
               <p>Therefore it followeth, that the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the worde, is alwayes neceſſarie in the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: Ieſus Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and eſtabliſhed the miniſters of the worde,<note place="margin">Ephe. 14.11.</note> for the worke of the miniſterie, till wee all meete together (in the vnitie of faith and knowledge of the ſonne of GOD) vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, that is to ſay, till that Chriſt be perfect in vs, and haue in vs his ful grouth and increaſe. But wee can not obtaine ſuche perfection vnto the ende of the worlde, at what time GOD ſhall bee all in all. For as Saint Paule ſaith, <hi>Wee knowe in parte, and wee propheſie in part. But when that which is perfect is come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. <hi>13.</hi> 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>then that which is in part ſhalbe aboliſhed.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that Ieſus Chriſte hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and placed the miniſters of the worde, for the woorke of the miniſterie, vntill the ende of the worlde, and then God ſhall be all in all.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons are ſufficient for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to teach and proue that the holy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, is continually requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3532:103"/> in the Church: as indeede, the Lorde hath for our good &amp; ſaluation eſtabliſhed the ſame, to abide in all ages, therein apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and framing himſelf, to our weakneſſe, which is ſo great (we being corrupted tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſinne) that without this means meet and agreeable to our nature, we coulde not bee well inſtructed in the points of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For if God ſhould ſpeake vnto vs in his maieſtie, wee coulde not at any hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with or abide his preſence, as wee may ſee it, by thoſe, that when hee was minded to publiſhe and to giue his lawe, the people the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues beeing aſtoniſhed, with his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; maieſtie, ſaid vnto Moſes,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.16 Deut. 5.29.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Talke thou with vs, &amp; we will heare. But let not the Lord talk with vs, leſt we die:</hi> And God accepting this their requeſt, ſaide vnto Moſes, <hi>I haue hearde the woordes of the voyce of this people, which they haue ſpoken vnto thee: they haue wel ſaid, al that they haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Oh that there were ſuche a heart in them to feare mee, and to keep al my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements alway, that it might goe well with them, and with their children for euer. Go, ſay vnto them, return into your tents, but ſtand thou heere with me, &amp; I wil tell thee all the commandements, &amp; the ordinances,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 5.30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; the lawes, which thou ſhalt teach them, that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3532:104"/> they may doe them, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore God yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto this people their requeſt, to wit, that they might bee taught, by the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Moſes. And ſithence that time, it was yet his good pleaſure, to haue continued, and that vnto the ende, this manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and teaching his Church, by the miniſterie of men, which order men them ſelues did require and chooſe: in ſo much, that when God himſelfe ſent Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.38 Heb. 2.16.</note> to preache the Goſpell, hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, to take vpon him, not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels, but the ſeede of Abraham, that he might be like vnto vs in all thinges, yet without ſinne. And Chriſte himſelfe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending to heauen, committed vnto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (who were men as we) the office and charge to teache vs.<note place="margin">Act. 14.15.</note> And ſince that time, this order hath continued, and is common and ordinarie in the Churche, and can not bee ſeparated from the Church, to wit, that God doth teache vs, by the miniſterie of men, as by his inſtruments, which are moſt profitable,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>8.</hi>27. &amp;c.</note> familiar and eaſie to vs. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch of Candace Queene of the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, tead in his chariot the holy ſcriptures: and no doubt, the Lorde coulde very well haue inſtructed him, in the myſteries of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3532:104"/> faith, by the ſecrete vertue and power of his holy ſpirite, but yet hee delighted rather to haue it done by the miniſterie of Phillip, and liked better therof.<note place="margin">Act. 10.1.2. &amp;c.</note> Cornelius the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, to the ende he might bee more fully inſtructed in the knowledge of the Goſpel, was ſent backe (as it were) from the Angell to Saint Peter: <hi>Hee ſhall tell thee</hi> (ſayth the Angell) <hi>what thou oughteſt to doe.</hi> Yea Saint Paule himſelfe, although that the Lord had ſpoken vnto him with his owne mouth, was yet notwithſtanding ſent backe (as it were) to Ananias,<note place="margin">Act. 9.3.4. &amp;c.</note> that he might be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and receiue the holy Ghoſte, and bee baptiſed. Wherefore they that doe caſt from them, or diſallow the miniſterie of the Church, hanging vpon, and loking for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall and diuine reuelations, to inſtruct them, doe not onely deceiue themſelues, but alſo violate and breake the order, which God hath eſtabliſhed in his Church, for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now there remaineth, to ſee and knowe howe much wee ought to deferre and giue to the miniſterie, for if they bee deceiued which deſpiſe it, and do not their duetie in that behalfe, which they ought, they are
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3532:105"/> deceiued alſo, which attribute or giue ouer muche vnto it. Wherefore wee ſay, that we ought not to giue to it, either more or leſſe, than that which belongeth thereto, &amp; that as it is good reaſon that the authoritie and credite thereof, ſhould bee reſerued vnto it ſelfe ſafe and ſounde, ſo wee ought to take good heede of this, that wee pull not from God the honour which is due vnto him. For this purpoſe and point, wee muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerue and marke this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Sometimes man is compared with God, when the miniſter is mentioned or ſpoken of, and then it is ſaid, that hee is not able to doe any thing at all, and that his labour or worke is altogether vnprofitable. As when Saint Paul ſaith:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Neither is he that planteth, any thing, neither is he that watereth, but God that giueth the increaſe.</hi> For what can man haue in himſelf, if he would enter into this, to parte or deuide a matter betweene God and himſelfe? we muſt therefore take heede of this, not ſo much as once to thinke, that the vertue and power of the holy Ghoſte, ſhoulde be tied and bound to the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of men, as though without it god could not work in mens harts, euen as ſhall pleaſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3532:105"/> himſelfe, as we ſee that they of the Romiſhe Church ſuppoſe and thinke, as appeareth in this, that they ſpare not to affirme, that in childe die without baptiſme adminiſtred by man, it cannot bee ſaued: and on the other ſide, that they which receiue the outwarde ſignes from the miniſters hands, receiue by and by the grace of God, which is tyed to thoſe ſignes. But god ſaith by his prophets, <hi>That it belongeth to him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 31.<hi>33.</hi> Ezech. 11.<hi>19</hi> Iere. 32.40. Iſai. 43.25.</note> 
                  <hi>to write his lawe in mens harts, to take away from them their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie harts, and to giue them heartes of fleſhe, to renue within them a new ſpirite, to put his feare in their heartes, that they ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte from.</hi> Shortly: <hi>That it is he alone,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.21.</note> 
                  <hi>to whom it belongeth to pardon ſinnes, and to ſaue.</hi> And we heare that which Saint Paule ſaith, <hi>That it appertaineth to GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor. 3.</hi>7.</note> 
                  <hi>to giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to that which the miniſters plant &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> And Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.44 65</note>

               </p>
               <p>Sometimes alſo the ſcripture ſpeaketh of man, without comparing God and him together, and then, in reſpect that God v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his miniſterie, to accompliſhe his owne worke by, that is attributed to him, which is proper and peculiar to God.

                  <p>Of the holineſſe of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE haue ſeene and heard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, that the Church is the companie of faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is alſo called the communion or fellowſhip of the Saints &amp;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3532:107"/> holy ones. The Church therfore is holy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is compacted or made of Saints or holy ones. But here wee muſt marke foure points.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, howe and in what ſenſe, wee are called Saints or holy ones it is not as the idiots or ignorant people vnderſtande it, who by Saintes, meane none other, but thoſe which are alreadie dead, and ſo cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed by the Pope, or els the Prieſtes and Friers, clad in white, or blacke and girded with a rope. But by ſaints wee vnderſtande them, who being elected from before all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingnes of time, are in their time (that is to ſay, in the time which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, before the foundations of the worlde were laid) ſanctified by GOD, through Ieſus Chriſt, and clothed with true faith. Now ſuch are all true Chriſtians and faithfull people.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde: that it is not of our ſelues that wee are Saintes, or holy ones,<note place="margin">Pſa. 51.5. &amp;c Gen. 8.21.</note> neither of our owne nature, for by our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all wee are altogether corrupted, and <hi>the children of wrath.</hi> But wee are ſaints,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>8.</hi>6. &amp;c Ephe. 2.3. Ioh. <hi>17.19.</hi>
                  </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Ieſus Chriſte hath ſanctified vs, as hee him ſelfe ſaith in Saint Iohn, <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelfe, that they alſo may be
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3532:108"/> ſanctified through the truth.</hi> Nowe hee hath ſanctified vs by the vertue and power of his holy ſpirite, which by reaſon of this effecte is called <hi>the ſpirite of ſanctification.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.</hi>4.</note> And this is that which Saint Paule meaneth, when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.25.26.27.</note> that <hi>Ieſus Chriſte hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Church, and hath ſanctified it, that hee might make it vnto him ſelfe, a glorious Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe this ſanctification of holineſſe, is brought to paſſe, firſt by the imputation or account of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe vnto vs, for hee was giuen vnto vs by the Father,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> to be our ſanctification. Secondly, by the purging or cleanſing of our filthineſſes, that is to ſay, by the forgiueneſſe of our ſins in the blood of Ieſus Chriſte, as Saint Paule declareth it in the Corinthians, when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.5.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Bee not deceiued, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, nor theeues, nor couetous, nor drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, nor railers, nor extortioners, ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite the kingdome of God, and ſuch were ſome of you, but yee are waſhed, but yee are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but yee are iuſtified, in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the ſpirite of our God.</hi> And indeede Saint Paule in an other place ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3532:108"/> that filthineſſe is oppoſed and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſanctification and holyneſſe, when he ſaith to the Romanes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19.</note> 
                  <hi>As you haue giuen your members ſeruants to vncleanneſſe and iniquitie, to commit iniquitie: ſo now giue your members ſeruauntes vnto righteouſneſſe in holines.</hi> Alſo to the Theſſalonians,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>God hath not called vs vnto vncleanneſſe, but vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thirde pointe is, That the holineſſe of the Churche is not at any time perfecte, ſo long as ſhee trauelleth and fighteth in this worlde: whiche maior I prooue thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if the Church were without ſpot in this world, in vaine hath our Sauiour Chriſt taught it alwayes to pray,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>forgiue vs our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and ſinnes.</hi> But the Lorde Ieſus hath not without good cauſe giuen vs ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and inſtruction, wherefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Churche, is not in this worlde without ſpot, yea rather that ſhee hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall need alwaies for to pray vnto God, that ſhee may bee more and more ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obteine the forgiueneſſe of all her ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe which are without ſpot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3532:109"/> and wrinckle, haue nothing to doe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waſhing, becauſe they haue no neede thereof. But the faithfull although they bee waſhed, haue notwithſtanding neede yet of waſhing ſtill, as Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it vnto vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.10.</note> when hee ſaith, <hi>Hee that is waſhed, needeth not ſaue to waſhe his feet.</hi> For by the waſhing of the feete, hee meaneth a continuall ſanctification. It followeth then that the faithful are not in this world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.2</note>Thirdly, Saint Paule ceaſeth nor, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orne and bewtifie the Corinthians, with the title of the Church, who notwithſtanding greeuouſly abuſed the holy ſupper of the Lorde, and had amongeſt them diuiſions, and partakings, which are not ſmal faultes, yea indeede they were in doubt alſo, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſurrection of the dead.<note place="margin">Gal. <hi>1.</hi>2.</note> Alſo he nameth the aſſembly of the Galathians, the Churche, although that poore people were deceaued by falſe Prophetes, and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to another goſpel, contrarie vnto that, which he had preached vnto them. Theſe places doe manifeſtlye declare that the Church is neuer ſo pure and perfect in this worlde, but that it hath alwayes neede to bee more and more purged and ſanctified.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3532:109"/> Which thing Saint Paule ſheweth yet more plainely, and openly, when hee writeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Theſſalonians. For hee calleth them the Church,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.1 <hi>1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5.23</hi>
                  </note> and yet hee prayeth vnto God for them, <hi>that he would ſanctifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is that the Nouatians, Donatiſts, and Anabaptiſtes (who doe not agree with vs, in this point) are not without their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies For firſt, they alleadge vnto vs that which S. Paule writeth vnto the Epheſians: <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt gaue himſelf for his church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">EPhe. 5.25 26.<hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that he might ſanctifie it, and cleanſe it, that he might make it vnto himſelfe a glorious church, not hauing ſpot or wrinckle, but that it ſhoulde bee holy and without blame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wee want not an aunſwere alſo. Saint Paul conſidereth the Churche not in her ſelfe, but in Ieſus Chriſte her heade, whiche ſhee taketh holde of by faith: So ſhee is ſaid to bee without wrinckle and vnblameable, by reaſon, not of her owne righteouſneſſe, but of Ieſus Chriſtes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, whereof ſhee is made partaker, becauſe it pleaſeth God to impute and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the ſame vnto her: for whiche cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, it is in another place,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30</note> that <hi>Ieſus Chriſte is made of God the father vnto vs, wiſedome,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3532:110"/> righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer wee might ſaye, that S. Paule ſpeaketh of ſanctification or holineſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and which is not yet full accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as though hee called and ſaide the Church to bee without ſpot, not that it is ſo here below on the earth, but bicauſe that one day it ſhall ſo bee aboue in heauen. And after this ſort Saint Auguſtine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth it.<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. de nuptiis &amp; concupiſc. cap. <hi>34.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Ieſus Chriſte</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>cleanſeth his Churche by the waſhing of Chriſtians, to make it vnto himſelfe, without ſpot or wrinckle, not in this worlde, but in the world to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They alleadge moreouer that whiche Saint Iohn ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Iob. <hi>3.</hi>6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I aunſwere by a diſtinction. Thoſe that are borne of God, that is to ſay, the faithfull, ſinne not, that is to ſay, ſerue not ſinne, or rather ſinne doth not raigne in them, becauſe they doe withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as muche as they can, or are inabled, from ſinne, and with all their hearte giue them ſelues to holineſſe of life, that they may glorifie GOD. And in this ſenſe Saint Iohn taketh it and ſpeaketh it. Again they that are borne of God, ſinne: that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3532:110"/> is to ſay, can not doe liue ſo holyly, but that oftentimes they ſtumble &amp; fall into ſinnes. For although they bee ſanctified, yet for all that, by reaſon of the reliques and rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of nature corrupted, whiche yet reſteth and remaineth in them, euery day they turne aſide from the right way, and ſinne. In this ſenſe Saint Iohn ment not that which he ſaith, that whoſoeuer is born of God ſinneth not, for ſo he ſhould ſpeake againſt him ſelfe, hauing before ſaide,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. <hi>1.</hi>8.10</note> 
                  <hi>If wee ſaye wee haue no ſinne, wee deceiue our ſelues, and truth is not in vs, yea wee make God a lyar, and his worde is not in vs.</hi> So it is then, that though there ſeeme to bee ſome contrarietie betweene thoſe two, to ſay, that wee are ſinners, and ſainctes bothe together, yet all agreeth together very well, for euerye man if wee conſider him in his owne nature, according to which he is called the childe of wrath, hee is a ſinner worthie of death, and eternall damnation: but if wee conſider him in Ieſus Chriſt as a Chriſtian and faithfull man, hee is holy, ſo that he ſinneth not, that is to ſay, ſerueth not ſinne, and his imperfections are hidden and couered, becauſe that they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, and moreouer the Lorde
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3532:111"/> Ieſus maketh him partaker of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And ſo beeing a ſinner in reſpect of his owne nature, hee is notwithſtanding reputed and accounted holy &amp; iuſt before God.</p>
               <p>But that which we haue hitherto ſpoken, toucheth or concerneth the members of the Church particularly. Wee may alſo well ſay, touching the Church conſidered in her owne bodie, that it ſhall neuer here be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from al filthineſſes, becauſe that ſo long as ſhee ſhall bee on earth, there ſhall bee in her wicked ones mingled with good ones. Which thing Ieſus Chriſt hath declared in the Goſpel, by two ſimilitudes.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>In the firſt hee ſaith: <hi>that the kingdome of heauen,</hi> that is to ſay, the Church, <hi>is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man, which ſowed good ſeede in his fielde, but while men ſlept, there came his enemie and ſowed tares amongeſt the wheate, and went his way. And when the blade was ſprong vp, and had brought foorth fruite, then appeared the tares alſo. Then came the ſeruaunts of the houſholde, and ſaide vnto him, Maſter ſowedſt thou not &amp;c.</hi> And woulde preſently haue gone and gathered them vp, but the Lorde woulde not ſuffer them, leaſt while they went about to gather the tares, they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3532:111"/> plucked vp alſo with them the wheate.</p>
               <p>Therefore hee willed that they might both growe together, vntill the harueſt, and in the time of harueſt, the reapers ſhall gather the tares, and binde them in ſheaues to burne them, but they ſhall gather the good corne into the Lords barne. Afterwards, he expoundeth the ſaide ſimilitude, ſaying: <hi>Hee that ſoweth the good ſeede is the ſonne of man, and the fielde is the worlde,</hi>

                  <hi>the good ſeede are the children of the kingdome, the tares are the children of the wicked, and the enemie that ſoweth them is the Diuell, the harueſt is the end of the world, and the reapers be the angels.

               </p>
               <p>In the ſeconde ſimilitude hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.47.<hi>48.</hi>
                  </note>

               </p>
               <p>By theſe two ſimilitudes Ieſus Chriſte very plainely expreſſeth, what ſhall bee the viſible ſtate and condition of the Churche, ſo long as it ſhall bee on earth: that is to ſay, that the wicked ſhall continually be ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein with the good, and that in ſuche ſorte, as the tares are amongeſt the good wheate in the fieldes, and as euill fiſhes are mingled with the good in the Sea.

                  </hi> word church is heere to be taken: I meane, whether wee
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3532:114"/> muſt vnderſtand this of the Catholike and vniuerſall churche, or els of the particular Churches. But the controuerſie is not in my iudgement, of the Catholike church: for wee all agree heerein, that ſhee cannot erre as touching faith. And indeede howe ſhoulde ſhee erre, ſeeing that following Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte her head and her husband, ſhee walketh not in darkeneſſe, but in the light of life? On the other ſide it is impoſſible, that all faithfull people vniuerſally, euen from the firſt vnto the laſt, ſhoulde fall into errour, for there haue beene alwayes ſome preſerued, through the goodneſſe and grace of GOD, by whome trueth it ſelfe through other mens naughtines, brought as it were to nothing, or at the leaſt deſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and forſaken, hath yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding been reſtored to her former force, and is yet ſtill mainteined and preſerued.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this queſtion is touching a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churche. Touching which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good vnto vs, in the firſt place to heare the iudgement and reaſons, of the Romiſhe Catholikes, vppon this that they affirme, that the churche ſo taken cannot erre, following herein the Nouatians, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſtes, and other heretikes. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3532:114"/> we will ſhew foorth, &amp; put downe, our aduiſe and reaſons, to proue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
               <p>The Romiſhe Catholikes thinke, that the churche cannot erre, although ſhee doe and appoint any thing without the worde of God, for beeing guided by the holie Ghoſt, ſhe may goe and walke without the order and direction of the worde, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhee goe and walke, yet ſhee cannot erre, or goe aſtray. But they ſeparate that whiche ought alwayes to remaine &amp; abide ioyned together, for if the churche followe not the worde of God, it is impoſſible to keepe her from error, as on the other ſide, if ſhee followe it, therein ſhe doth well, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre. The reaſons wherby they would perſuade men, that the church cannot erre, are theſe following.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: Ieſus Chriſte doeth not at any time forſake his churche, whiche is his ſpouſe or wife. Wherefore it followeth, that it cannot erre.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere by a diſtinction: So farre foorth, as the church foloweth Ieſus Chriſt, it cannot bee forſaken of him, and cannot erre: but in as muche, as it liuing in the worlde, doeth ſtray from Chriſt, and goeth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3532:115"/> aſide from gods commandements, it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of him and doth erre.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: The Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The piller and ground of truth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim. 3.</hi>15.</note> Wherfore it cannot erre.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there is in this argument a double error, the one touching the word Church. For Saint Paule meaneth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, &amp; not any particular one. The other is concerning the meaning of the Apoſtle. For he calleth the Church, the piller and ground of truth, not that it is ſo ſimplie and indeede of it ſelfe, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of vs, becauſe that the truth of God, hath not place in the worlde, ſaue onely in the Church. For as much therefore as God maintaineth his truth amongeſt men,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 3 cap. 1. ad Timoth.</note> and maketh it alwayes to goe his right courſe, by the miniſterie of the Churche, therefore is the Church called the piller and grounde of the truth. To be ſhort, becauſe that God himſelfe commeth not downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and doth not euery day ſende his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to maintaine his truth among men, &amp; to publiſh it to the world, but vſeth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the Church, for this effect, that is to ſay, the preaching of the word, for this cauſe it is called the columne or pillar of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3532:115"/> truth, becauſe that by the preaching of the worde, it is reteined amongeſt men, and countergarded, to the ende that it decaye not or periſh from the memorie or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of men,</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon: The Church is gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and guided by the holy Ghoſte: howe then can it erre?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> aunſwere: that ſo farre foorth, as the Church is gouerned by the holy ghoſte, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it himſelfe to be guided by him &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth him, ſhee cannot erre, but if ſhee doe the contrary, ſhee may erre and doeth erre.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon. In the kingdome of heauen no error can haue any place.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24.16.19.</note> For trueth reigneth therein, but the Churche is the kingdome of heauen: It followeth then, that in the Church no error can haue place.</p>
               <p>All this is true of the Catholike Church, yea and of particular Churches alſo, ſo farre foorth as they ſhewe themſelues to bee the kingdome of heauen, and not the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this worlde, and of the fleſhe: that is to ſay, ſo farre foorth as they are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies ſubiect in al things to Ieſus Chriſt the king of heauen. But where is that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3532:116"/> church ſo obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Ieſus Chriſt the king of heauen, that it erreth not, and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, in many points and particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The fifth reaſon: councels cannot erre, but the church conſiſteth of councels, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the church cannot erre.</p>
               <p>This Syllogiſme pretendeth and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to proue an vncertaine thing, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, yet more vncertaine. For many examples do plainely teſtifie, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels may erre, as indeede they haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times erred. And touching the firſt: the councell that Ahab aſſembled, of foure hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred prophetes, did not it erre? It is written that they beeing come to this wicked king to flatter him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> King. <hi>22.</hi>6. &amp;c.</note> Satan was ſent out, by and from God, to bee a lying ſpirite in their mouthes: ſo all of them, with one conſent, condemned the truth: Michaiah alone withſtanding them, who was reprooued as an heretike, beaten and put into priſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. <hi>11.</hi>47</note>The councell which the high Prieſts and phariſees aſſembled in Ieruſalem againſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, did not it erre? wee ſee how they condemned Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; litle regarded: yea much deſpiſed his doctrine.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall wee ſay of the councels
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3532:116"/> and Synods, which were helde and kept af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the apoſtles, euen vnto our age, whereof ſome haue reproued and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that, which was eſtabliſhed and done by others: for of neceſſitie either the one or the other haue erred, they being repugnant and contrary one to another. Examples hereof.</p>
               <p>The councell of Carthage (in whiche Saint Cyprian was preſident) did decree,<note place="margin">Con. Cartha.</note> that thoſe whiche were baptiſed by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, ſhoulde bee baptiſed againe.

               <p>The councell of Conſtantinople,<note place="margin">Con. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> called by the Emperour Leo, about nine hundred yeeres agoe, ordeined, that men ſhoulde throwe downe and breake in peeces, all
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3532:117"/> the images that were in Churches: which ordinaunce, the Councell aſſembled at Nice,<note place="margin">Con. Nicen.</note> by the commaundement of Irene, the Emperours mother, was immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broken and cracked, and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen, that Images ſhould be ſet vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. 2. de Baptiſ. contra Dona<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſt. cap. 3.</note>To bee ſhort, Saint Auguſtine plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that which I ſpeake, to wit, that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels may erre. For he expreſly ſaith, that the letters and Epiſtles of particular Biſhops are corrected by prouinciall councels, and the prouinciall councels, by vniuerſall: and the former vniuerſal councels annihilated
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3532:117"/> and diſanulled by the latter, when by ſome certaine experience of thinges, that which before was ſecrete, is opened, &amp; that which was hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is made euident and plaine: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it ſtand them in any ſteede at all, to ſay, that this place of Auguſtine ought to be vnderſtood of outward and indifferente things, for Saint Auguſtine diſputeth there of a point of doctrine, that is to ſay, of the opinion of Saint Cyprian, and of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Affrica, touching rebaptiſation or baptiſing againe.</p>
               <p>Now then in ſo great diuerſitie, and gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying one of another, what ſhall wee ſay? To whiche councell ſhall wee giue greater faith and credit? For this we perceiue cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainely, that they thus croſſing and contrarying one an other, did not all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſpeake, according to the truth: &amp; that therefore wee muſt of neceſſitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſome of them haue erred, and that by their falſe and erronious determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they haue degenerated and gone aſtray, from the right way of the worde of God.</p>
               <p>Certainely it is very meete and requiſite,<note place="margin">An admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching Councels and Synods</note> that wee ſhoulde bee wiſe and very well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, when the queſtion is, either to ſet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3532:118"/> out, or to receiue that, which ſhal bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by councels and Synods. For it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together manifeſt and plaine, that councels and Synodes may be deceiued. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as touching their decrees and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, this is that wee haue to ſay, that we muſt bring the weight of them, &amp; make it ſubiect to the balance, that is to ſay, wee muſt trie and examine them by the worde of God,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.8.</note> which is indeed the balance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto not only men are ſubiect, but <hi>alſo the Angels,</hi> as S. Paule teacheth in his Epiſtle to the Galathians.</p>
               <p>Wherefore whatſoeuer we ſhall finde in them conformable, and agreeable, to the proportion of faith, and agreeing with the authoritie of the holy ſcriptures, wee ought to receiue the ſame without any ſcruple or doubt. But if they propound vnto vs, and ſet out, thinges contrarie to that, we ought and we may without any difficultie or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, reiect and refuſe them, as ſuſpected and dangerous doctrines. For as Saint Ierome hath ſometimes ſaide,<note place="margin">Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. in 9. cap. Ierem.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee ought not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the errors of our fathers and predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, but the authoritie of the ſcriptures, and the commandement of God</hi> Who teacheth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3532:118"/> vs.<note place="margin">Gerſon. par. <hi>1.</hi> de exam. doctrin. Abbas Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normita. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. de electia one &amp; elect. poteſt. cap. 5.</note> Whereupon alſo Gerſon and Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitan haue concluded, that in matters which concerne faith, the Pope and his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, may not determine and decree anye thing, againſt the worde of God: and that if a generall councell ſhoulde come ſo far, as to decline, and goe aſide, either through malice, or through ignorance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, a ſimple man alleadging in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the worde of God, ought rather to bee heard and yeelded vnto then all they.</p>
               <p>Let vs enter or come nowe to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and let vs bring foorth and alledge our reaſons to prooue that the Churche may erre.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon is this: That great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the people of Iſrael, which was in the wilderneſſe, with whome GOD had made a couenant, and had made them bounde vnto him, by an infinite number of benefites and good turnes, &amp; had giuen vnto them Sacraments, and Ceremonies, which were, as it were viſible ſignes of his grace, that great companie I ſay, was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry goodly and a very excellent Churche. But they were vilely deceaued and erred fowly, when forſaking the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3532:119"/> they made vnto themſelues a golden calfe offering and giuing vnto it, that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which was due to God alone, yea and Aaron himſelfe the high prieſt, did not ſo conſtantly and boldly withſtande them as he ought, but rather conſented thereto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, wherefore it followeth, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> the church may erre and be deceiued.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: The Church in olde time did offer and giue the holy Supper, to little infants, ſtaying and grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, vpon the place of Saint Iohn, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept yee eate the fleſhe of the ſonne of Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 9.15.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you.</hi> And this cuſtome was in vſe in the time of pope Innocent, Saint Cyprian and Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, as it appeareth by their writinges.</p>
               <p>But nowe this is not any more vſed, for children whiche can not prooue and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them ſelues, are not at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to the partaking of the Sacrament. Wherefore the Churche in olde time hath erred, or els it erreth now. But if we would anſwere, that the Churche hath power and authoritie to chaunge ſuche cuſtomes and manners: I replie to the contrarie: for now the queſtion is not heere, of a thing indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the vſe, but of the worde of God,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3532:119"/> which is alwayes conſtant, and not ſubiect to any change, as to ſay, that to day it hath one ſenſe and vnderſtanding, &amp; to morrow another, wherefore if the place of S. Iohn, commaunde to giue the ſupper to little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of neceſſitie, as the forenamed anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, haue vnderſtood and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſame, the Church hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one well in time heretofore to follow that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and at this time it erreth, in not follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it any longer. Or els if the ſaid place, be not to be referred properly vnto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper, neither commaundeth to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and giue the ſacrament to infants: but it is of neceſſitie required, that he to whom wee muſt adminiſter the ſaide ſacrament, haue knowledge to <hi>trie and examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> according to Saint Paules doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <hi>1.</hi>2.</note> as indeede this is the pure and only truth: it followeth then, that the Churche hath in former time erred, to admit little infants to the holy ſupper, and that at this day it doth well to practiſe the contrary.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: If the Churche coulde not erre, Saint Paule had without cauſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28</note> 
                  <hi>leaſt the Corinthians</hi> (whome he calleth a Church) <hi>ſhoulde through the ſubtiltie of the ſerpent bee corrupted,</hi>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3532:120"/> the ſimplicitie that is in Chriſt.</hi> And indeede, in vaine ſhoulde hee haue called the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Corinthians and Galathians,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Churches,</hi> which yet notwithſtanding er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in doctrine, in faith, in manners, and in life.

               <p>The fourth reaſon: Thoſe that cannot erre, haue no neede of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes: but the Churche hath neede of the forgiuenes of ſinnes, for Ieſus Chriſt giuing it a forme of praier, hath commanded it, to demaund and aske of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.12.</note>

               <p>The fift reaſon: The Church which was in olde time in Ieruſalem, was oftentimes reproued of error, by the Prophetes, which thing declareth, that the Church is not in this worlde, without will and deed to erre. But to the end I may not be ouerlong, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyting by peecemeale, and as it were one by one, all the ſentences, which make mention of the falles of the Churche, let men reade that, whiche is written thereof in theſe

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether the Church bee aboue the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: that is to ſay, whether the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depend of the iudgement and authority of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Church indeede hath a very great authoritie among men, in ſo much as, it behoueth vs to heare the ſame, if we will not be accounted rebels againſt God. Yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing ſhe is the wife and ſcholler of Ieſus Chriſte, ſhe ought alwaies to be ſubiect vnto him, as vnto her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, head and teacher. And therefore this is an article, which wee muſt hold inuiolable and without breach, to wit, that the church ought to depend and hang on Chriſte, and his worde, and to haue her authoritie, from the ſame worde, and not on the other ſide, that the worde of Chriſte, ſhoulde depende and haue the credite and authoritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3532:122"/> from the Church. Notwithſtanding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are founde whiche holde altogether the contrarie, ſetting (as we ſay) the cart before the horſes, and plowe or waine before the oxen, and vtterly ouerthrowing all order. For they ſuppoſe, that the holy ſcripture hath no more certaintie &amp; authoritie, than it pleaſeth the Church, that by her allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and conſent it ſhall haue. And theſe bee the Romiſhe Catholikes, who ſpeake of the Church after this manner, giuing it autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer and aboue the worde of God, to make men to beleeue, that whatſoeur it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth, determineth and concludeth, wee muſt hold her iudgement, ſentence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, as a certaine oracle, comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, and to be ſhort, as an article of our beliefe. And behold their reaſons for this.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon: The Churche by her iudgement hath brought to paſſe, that the holy Scripture hath beene acknowledged for the true worde of God, and hath diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ſeparated and ſundered it, from all other writinges what ſo euer, whiche men haue publiſhed &amp; brought into the world. For who is it that in the beginning hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured vs, that the holy ſcripture is the word of God, but the Church alone? And who is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3532:122"/> it, that euen to this day can certifie and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs, that the ſame word of God, is come ſafe, ſound, and whole, euen vnto our age, but onely the ſame Church? Wherefore it followeth, that the authoritie and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the holie ſcripture, dependeth vpon the authoritie and iudgemente of the Church.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere two things, or two manner of wayes. Firſt, that this is a moſt wicked opinion to ſay, that without the Churche, the worde of God could not haue, a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſſe, to commend and ſet forth the authoritie and credite thereof vnto vs. Let vs heare what Saint Auguſtine ſaith hereof. The authoritie of the truth (ſaith hee) is fruitefull and plentifull:<note place="margin">Augu. de aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpt. Virg. Mart. cap. 1.</note> and if ſhe be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examined, men ſhall finde, that of her ſelfe, ſhee maketh her ſelfe to bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowne. Wherefore Alfonſus de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro, hath ſometimes ſaide:<note place="margin">Alfonſus de Caſt. li. <hi>1.</hi> ca. 8. cont. haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> ſeeing that the holie ſcripture is come foorth from GOD, it hath of it ſelfe alreadie deſerued, that wee ſhoulde giue truſt vnto it, and beleeue it. And when the Church publiſheth this, that it is giuen by God, ſhee doth wholie, euen as a witneſſe, which beareth witneſſe to ſome thing. So that the truth of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3532:123"/> is certaine, not becauſe of the witnes, but by reaſon of it ſelfe, and the credite it hath, and not becauſe the Church receiueth it, and publiſheth it, but becauſe that God hath giuen it, and made the ſame manifeſt vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, is this a ſmall matter, that wee haue the teſtimonie of the holye ſpirite dwelling in our heartes? It is ſaid that it is his peculiar office, <hi>to guide and lead vs into all truth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.13. <hi>1. Ioh.</hi> 2.27.</note> 
                  <hi>and to teach vs all things.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followeth, that he teacheth vs this truth: that the holy ſcripture is of God, and from him. It is ſaide moreouer, <hi>that we haue receiued the ſpirite of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>that we might knowe the thinges that are giuen to vs of God.</hi> Alſo,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that the thinges of the ſpirite of God, are ſpirituallie diſcerned,</hi> that is to ſay, by <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, mouing, and woorking of the holy ſpirite. Wherefore it followeth, that the holy ſpirite teacheth vs, and maketh vs to diſcerne, betweene theſe bookes which wee ought to receiue without gaineſaying, and the other, which we ought to reiect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps will ſay, that this article or point is daungerous, becauſe that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes oftentimes bragge, that they haue the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3532:123"/> ſpirit of God, which they haue not indeed: and wee knowe howe they haue alwayes indeuoured, to make their doctrines of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and credite, through their inwarde reuelations, whiche they haue imagined to proceede, from the holy Ghoſt. But we can eaſily aunſwere this: to wit, that in this matter, wee can eaſily auoide all danger, if wee vſe and followe the remedies whiche S. Iohn doth furniſh vs withall, when he ſaith: that <hi>we ought not to beleeue euery ſpirite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.<hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but to trie and proue the ſpirites, whether they are of God or no.</hi> And what ſhall be the meane and way of this triall and examination? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the worde of God, as wee ſee, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the men of Berea,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11.</note> did proue S. Paule his ſpirit and doctrine. And to this meane doth Chryſoſtome ſend vs, when hee ſaith thus: <hi>Many boaſt of the ſpirite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. de ſanct. &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. ſpirit.</note> 
                  <hi>but they which bring any thing of their owne, doe falſly pretende the ſame.</hi> As Chriſt witneſſed, that he ſpake not of him ſelfe, becauſe that his doctrine was taken out of the lawe and prophetes: in like manner, if any vnder the title and name of the ſpirite, ſhall bring vnto vs any thing, which is not contained in the Goſpell, let vs not beleue it. For as Chriſt is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhmente, and fulfilling of the lawe and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3532:124"/> Prophetes: ſo is the holie Ghoſt of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
               <p>But how can wee by this way or meane, diſcerne and know the ſpirites, that is to ſay, whether the doctrine which they ſhall propound and ſet foorth vnto vs, bee from the holy Ghoſte or no? After two ſortes or by two meanes, you ſhall knowe this. Firſt, if it tend to this end, to exalt, eſtabliſh and ſet vp the glorie of God. For as Ieſus Chriſte ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that ſeeketh the glorie of God is true, and no vnrighteouſneſſe is in him.</hi> Secondly, if it bee conformable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>to the proportion of faith,</hi> that is to ſay, if it agree and accorde well, with the heads &amp; foundations of Chriſtian religion, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more largely heretofore, in the fourth Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, that I aunſwere, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the foreſaide reaſon of the Romiſhe Catholikes, is, that the conſequence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is not neceſſarie, neither well grounded, when they ſaye, that the Churche yeeldeth teſtimonie to the worde of God, and doth commend the ſame vnto vs, that therefore the certaintie and authoritie of the worde of God, dependeth vpon the authority and iudgement of the Church. For as wee haue
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3532:124"/> but a little while agoe alleadged out of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſus de Caſtro: The word of God is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, not by reaſon of the Church, whiche beareth witneſſe thereof, but becauſe of it ſelfe, and his owne credite. The Apoſtles yelded teſtimonie, and bare witneſſe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.17. Acts. <hi>1.8.</hi>
                  </note> And who is hee that will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay, that Ieſus Chriſte his authoritie doth depende of the authoritie and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtles? The Goldſmith tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the golde, and putteth a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene that which is good and pure, and that which is naughtie mettall. But doth hee therefore by his tryall and proofe make that the golde is either good or euill? A Parliament receiueth ſome edict or lawe which commeth from the King, that it may bee publiſhed and proclaimed. Inquirie is diligently made, whether it come from the King or no: Afterwardes all knowe that it commeth from the King: what doth the Parliament then? It is true that it alloweth the edict, that it acknowledgeth the ſame, that it beareth witneſſe to it, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſetteth out the ſame, yea, and if neede bee, interpreteth it, according to the Kings intent and meaning: But doth the parliament for all this, cauſe it or make it to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:3532:125"/> bee the kings lawe? Doth it giue authoritie to it? Hath it any authoritie, to chaunge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing in it, or to adde any thing to it, or to clippe, or take any thing what ſo euer away from it? It is certaine, no. Euen ſo ſtandeth the caſe with the Church. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be an excellent teſtimonie to the worde of God, yet it cannot at any hande giue it authoritie, as to ſay, that the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worde of God, hangeth vpon the authoritie and iudgement of the Churche. For when the Church acknowledgeth and alloweth the worde of God, and doth put a difference betweene it, &amp; the doctrines and inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of men, ſhe doth no other thing, but heare the voyce of her paſtor, &amp; diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth &amp; knoweth it <hi>fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the voice of a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>10.</hi>5.</note> Now there is great difference betwene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Paſtors voice from a ſtrangers, and adding authoritie and credite thereto, bringing to paſſe, and that according to truth, that it ſhould be ſuch or ſuch, that is, either true or falſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is: The Church is more auncient, than the Scriptures. For in the time of Adam, Abell, Seth, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Iaacob, there was no ſcripture: For Moſes was the firſt penman or writer
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:3532:125"/> of matters concerning religion, and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding there was a church. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, that the authoritie of the Church, is aboue the authoritie of the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Firſt and formoſt I aunſwere, that the conſequence of this argument is none at al. For graunt it, that one thing be more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and old than another, yet it followeth not for all that, that it ſhould be of greater authoritie and credite: otherwiſe we muſt inferre, that Moſes hath more authoritie, than Ieſus Chriſte, and the lawe more than the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as touching the antecedent or former propoſition, I ſay that it is ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, captious, and full of deceit. For albeit, that in theſe firſt times of the worlde, there was no ſcripture, which the fathers vſed, yet for all that, the worde of God ceaſed not to bee, becauſe it was written and ingrauen in the fathers heartes, and moreouer foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded verie cleerly in the Churche, whiche worde, was in good time brought and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, firſt by Moſes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by others, and thereupon called, the holie ſcripture: wherefore ſeeing that the holy ſcripture and Gods worde, is nothing
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:3532:126"/> but one and the ſelfe ſame thing, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very well, that if our firſt fathers haue had the word of God, they haue had alſo in ſubſtance, the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. cont. epiſt. funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. cap. 5.</note>The third reaſon: S. Auguſtine hath ſaid <hi>I woulde not beleeue the Goſpell, if the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Catholike Church, did not mooue mee thereto.</hi> Wherefore it is certaine, that the Goſpell taketh his authoritie from the Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwere that the conſequence is ſtarke naught, for that which S. Auguſtin ſpeaketh to one purpoſe, or in one reſpect, is applied to another end. This holy doctor ſpeaketh ſo, as hauing regarde to that, hee was then, when he tooke the part of the Manichees, and as it were diſputing againſt them. Now the Manichees would, that the Epiſtles of Manicheus their authour, which they called Fundamental, containing in it all their falſe opinions, ſhould be of like and equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, with the Apoſtles epiſtles. Beſide, they allowed one part of the Goſpel, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed an other, &amp; that not by the aduiſe and iudgement of the Church, but of their owne proper and particular authoritie. S. Auguſtine hauing taken in hand, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the ſaide Epiſtle in the beginning ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3532:126"/> thus: The Epiſtle beginneth after this manner: <hi>Manicheus the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſte, by the prouidence and appointment of God the Father: I aske, who is this Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us? you wil anſwere, the Apoſtle of Ieſus chriſts I beleeue it not. What wilt thou ſay thereto? Perhaps thou wilt bring foorth the Goſpel, and thereby thou wilt lift vp and eſtabliſh the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Manicheus. But what if thou haddeſt to doe and deale with a man, who doth not yet beleeue the Goſpel? what wouldeſt thou do, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee ſhould ſay vnto thee, I beleeue not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell? For as touching my ſelfe, I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Goſpel, if the authoritie of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church did not moue me thereto.</hi> Beholde Saint Auguſtines wordes, by which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together manifeſt, that he mindeth not to infer, that the Goſpell hangeth vppon the allowance and authoritie of the church, but only that the Church hath great weight, to induce and moue the miſcreants and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, to beleeue the Goſpel. This holy Doctor then ſpeaketh not, of the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith, but of the beginning thereof, that is to ſay, of the occaſion and outward meanes, by which he was prouoked &amp; ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, to beleeue the Goſpell, when hee
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3532:127"/> was a Manichean heretike, and not as yet a Chriſtian, to wit, becauſe he ſawe the good accorde, conſent, and agreement of the Church in receiuing the Goſpell. In the fourth Chapter he confeſſed, that in former time he maintained the Maniches part, and that hee was very eger and ſharpe therein, and blinded in the doctrine of their ſect. Now hee ſpeaketh thus: <hi>Howe wilte thou proue, that Manicheus is an Apoſtle of Chriſt? ſhall this bee by the Goſpell? But if ſome one that beleeueth not the Goſpel, woulde ſay vnto thee, I beleeue not the Goſpel, what haſt thou to replie?</hi> As <hi>if hee ſhoulde ſay,</hi> wouldeſt thou not purpoſe, put downe, and ſhewe vnto him the authoritie and teſtimonie of the Church? For as touching my ſelfe, in the time that I was a Manichean, I had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the Goſpel, if the authoritie and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the Catholike Churche, had not driuen mee thereto. As if againe he ſhould ſay: For as concerning my ſelfe, when I was of your faction and ſect, I was ſo ſetled &amp; ſtaied in your opinions, and had hard them ſo attentiuely and diligently, yea I belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them ſo ſtedfaſtly, and did maintaine them with ſuch courage and ſtomack, (this is that which hee ſpeaketh in the fourth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3532:127"/> Chapter) that very hardly I had euer forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and renounced them, to beleeue the Goſpell, if the authoritie and teſtimonie of the Church, had not induced, mooued and prouoked mee thereto.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: Hee that hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and power, to take away, or to change ſome thing in the worde of God, hath alſo authoritie ouer it. But ſo it is, that <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> church hath authoritie and power, to take away, or to change ſomething in the word of God: It followeth therfore, that the Church hath authoritie ouer and aboue it.</p>
               <p>They thus proue the aſſumption, whiche is the ſecond propoſition or ſentence of the reaſon. Saint Peter had authoritie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to take away and to chaunge ſome thing, in the worde of God, for he changed the forme of baptiſme preſcribed by Ieſus Chriſte, as appeareth by this, that Ieſus Chriſte hauing commaunded to baptiſe, <hi>in the name of the father, and of the ſonne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>28.</hi>19.</note> 
                  <hi>and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Saint Peter changing this forme, hath enioyned and commaunded men to bee baptized in the name of Ieſus Chriſte onely.<note place="margin">Act. <hi>2.</hi>38.</note> As it is written in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the Actes verſe 38. Nowe if Saint Peter haue had this authoritie and this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3532:128"/> why alſo ſhould not the whole church haue it, as well as hee?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, firſt for the conſequence, that it is not neceſſarie and good. For who is he that will yeelde to this, that all that, whiche was in former time permitted to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſhould nowe bee permitted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and miniſters of the Church, who are their ſucceſſors?</p>
               <p>Secondly I ſay, that that which is taken from Saint Peter as true and right, is falſe. For Saint Peter did in no caſe chaunge the forme of Baptiſme: and in the place of the Actes before alleadged, it is not ſaide, that they muſt be baptized in the name of Ieſus Chriſt onely,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38 P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

Ambroſe expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, is vnderſtoode the whole Trinitie, for when a man nameth Chriſt, theſe are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3532:128"/> to wit, the father, of whom the ſonne was annointed, and the ſonne, which was annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the holy Ghoſt, by whom or with whom hee was annointed.</hi> Beholde the aduiſe and iudgement of the maſter of the ſentences, who doth not altogether ſatisfie vs, though he ſpeake much for vs. For whether wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the ſubſtance of the ſacraments, or els the forme thereof, we holde that the Lords ordinance ought to be retained and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in the whole, and through the whole, and that it doth not belong to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon, no not to the church it ſelf, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or change any thing therein. And in deede, as I haue alreadie ſaide, Saint Peter did not chaunge the forme of Baptiſme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> But marke this: His intent &amp; purpoſe was to teach, that the foundation, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fulfilling of baptiſme, is in Ieſus Chriſte alone. For to bee baptiſed in the name of Chriſte, is taken and vſed by S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for to bee receiued to grace and fauour in baptiſme, by the name of Ieſus Chriſte. So that this manner of ſpeeche which Saint Peter vſeth, is not in any ſort to bee referred to the forme of Baptiſme: but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that all the vertue, power, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of baptiſme conſiſteth onely in Ieſus
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3532:129"/> Chriſte alone, becauſe that all that, whiche baptiſme doth repreſent and figure vnto vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.7. Rom. 6.4.</note> is comprehended in him alone. <hi>For by the blood of Ieſus Chriſte, wee are waſhed and purged from all our ſinnes, and by baptiſme bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him, to the end that as he is raiſed vp, from the dead by the glory of the father ſo wee alſo ſhould walke in newneſſe of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift reaſon: The Church hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Sabboth to the Lordes day, or that which we call Sunday, although that God by expreſſe writing, commaunded the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and keeping of the ſaid Sabboth, Wherfore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it followeth, that the church hath power and authoritie ouer the holy ſcripture.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere in the firſt place, That the Church hath changed nothing at all, of the commaundement, touching the obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sabaoth, in or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof, but onely in or concerning the circumſtance. For the thing or matter abideth alwaies, that is to ſay, the ſubſtance of the commaundement, ſeeing that one day of the weeke is reſerued, to be imploied and beſtowed vpon the holy reſt, whiche thing is enioyned by the commandement, as being indeede the veritie and truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3532:129"/> So that the obſeruation and keeping thereof is only chaunged in reſpect of the time, which change doth not derogate any thing from the commandement, &amp; neither altereth nor changeth any thing therein, of that which God minded to commend and commaund to vs.</p>
               <p>Next: the commaundement of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, in reſpect of the figure was tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and indured but a ſeaſon, and therfore it ought to haue an ende, as the other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the lawe had. Wherefore the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure was taken away and changed, not by the authoritie of the Church properly, or as you would ſay, of it owne authoritie, but by the trueth it ſelfe, which declared and ſhewed it ſelfe in Ieſus Chriſte: whereupon alſo the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col. 2.</hi> 16.17</note> 
                  <hi>Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, or of the newe moone, or of the Sabaoth day, which are but a ſhadowe of things to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixt reaſon: The Apoſtles decreed in the firſt Councell which they held in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,<note place="margin">Act. 15.<hi>29.</hi>
                  </note> that the Chriſtians <hi>ſhoulde abſtaine from blood, and from that that is ſtrangled:</hi> which decree, yea brought and put into writing, the Church hath taken away and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3532:130"/> chaunged, after the time of the Apoſtles, giuing leaue to chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to vſe both blood, and that that is ſtrangled. It foloweth then, that it is lawefull for the Church, to change ſom thing in the word of God, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent that the Church is aboue the ſame worde.</p>
               <p>I aunſwere that the place of the Actes, touching that which the Apoſtles determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Councell, whiche they helde in Ieruſalem is ill vnderſtood, and yet more ill applied, to fetch and drawe from it ſuch a conſequence. For the Church after the Apoſtles, hath not eſtabliſhed any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the decree of the Apoſtles, in that they haue ſuffered Chriſtians, to vſe and eate blood, and that that is ſtrangled. For the decree of the Apoſtles was made, ſet vp and publiſhed, for a time onely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to ende. The Church in the time of the Apoſtles, was builded as well of the Gentiles as of the Iewes. Some weake ones amongeſt the Iewes, thought, that they were yet bounde in their conſciences, to the obſeruation of the lawe of Moſes, that is to ſay, to the ceremonies thereof: The Gentiles on the other ſide, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues with that Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3532:130"/> which Ieſus Chriſte hath brought vnto vs, woulde without any difference vſe, all manner of meates, and ſo amongſt the reſt, blood, and that that was ſtrangled. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Apoſtles, leaſt that ſo free a vſe of blood, and of that that was ſtrangled, might breede and bring ſome offence to the weake Iewes, determined and decreed in their Councell, that euerie one ſhoulde abſtaine from ſuch meate for a time, til that they might ſee a good agreement &amp; peace, betweene theſe two peoples. Now after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, the feare of ſuch an offence beeing taken away, the Church iudged, that the obſeruation and keeping of the ſaid decree, was not any more neceſſarie, or any longer needefull, and therefore reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and purpoſe of the Apoſtles, gaue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to the faithfull to vſe all kinde of meates, or els (to ſpeake better) did by the word of God declare vnto them the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that they had to vſe all maner of meates without, in any thing altering &amp; changing, the intent &amp; purpoſe of the Apoſtles, when they made and eſtabliſhed the foreſaide de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, not being appointed and ſet vp by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for a time onely.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the reaſons
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3532:131"/> of the Romiſh CatholikS, who affirme that the certaintie, &amp; truth of the word of God, doth depend of the iudgement and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church. Beholde nowe our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: The certaintie of the church dependeth vppon the authoritie of Gods word. It followeth then that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cannot bee true, to wit, that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the worde of God ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vpon the authoritie of the Churche. Nowe wee proue the antecedent or former propoſition, by that which the holie Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Churche is builded vppon the foundation and doctrine of the Prophetes and Apoſtles.</hi> Whereupon it followeth, that the Church dependeth vpon the authoritie of the ſame doctrine: And heereunto belong, the ſentences of the ancient doctors, which wee haue cited and quoted before in the third Chapter, by which this is ſhewed and proued, that the Church is marked, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and knowne, by the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: <hi>The holy ſcripture being giuen by inſpiration of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. <hi>3.</hi>16</note> as S. Paule ſaith, hath the authoritie from it ſelfe, as we haue declared in the beginning of this Chapter, in anſwering the firſt reaſon of the Romiſh
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3532:131"/> Catholikes: wherein we haue followed the iudgement of Alfonſus de Caſtro. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth then, that it taketh not credite or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Church, neither more not leſſe, than the edict and lawe of the King, which hath the authoritie it hath, from it ſelfe, that is to ſay, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king, from whom it proceedeth and commeth, and not from the Parliament, to which it is ſent, although that the ſame bee allowed, prayſed, yea and expounded ſometimes by the ſaide parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The thirde reaſon: If the word of God ought to be heard aboue the Church, then certainly it doth not hang of the authority of the Church, but that the worde of God ought to be heard aboue the Church, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this which S. Paule ſaith, that it ought to be heard aboue the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>yea the Angels them ſelues.</hi> Wherefore it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the word of God doth not hang of the authoritie of the Church.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon:<note place="margin">Aug. cont Max. lib. 3. cap. 14.</note> Saint Auguſtine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declareth, that the holy ſcripture is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Councels, and ſo by conſequent aboue the churche repreſented by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. For writing to Maximinus the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, touching the worde Homouſios, that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3532:132"/> is to ſay, conſubſtantiall, or of the ſelfe ſame ſubſtance together with the father, whiche word was confirmed by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Nice, and on the other ſide, diſallowed by the councel of Ariminum, in the time of the Emperour Conſtantine, he ſaith thus: <hi>Now I haue not to vſe or alleadge, the Councel of Nice, neither thou the Councel of Ariminum, to preuaile thereby one of vs againſt another. For as I am not bound to the Councel of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum, ſo art not thou bound to the Councel of Nice. We haue the authority of the ſcriptures, which are not partiall or particular witneſſes, for the one, or for the other, but are commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to both of vs. Let vs therefore by them diſpute, and reaſon of the matter in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene vs.</hi>

               <p>The firſt is,<note place="margin">Diſcipline is neceſſarie in the church.</note> that diſcipline is moſt requiſite &amp; moſt neceſſarie in the Church, if wee will not haue all thinges mingled and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therein, yea full of confuſion. For euen as there is no Citie, nor Towne, nor houſe, which can bee without diſcipline, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or ſome order, for the gouernement thereof: ſo the Church which is the citie &amp; houſe of God, cannot at any hand be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his policie and ſpiritual gouernment.

                  <note place="margin">Cypri. lib. 2, epiſt. 7.</note> thereby to declare, not onely how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable the ſame is for vs, but alſo howe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and needeful. For ſeeing that the churche is in this worlde, as a ſhip vpon the Sea, that is to ſay, ſubiect to the billowes, waues, and tempeſtes of tyrants and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, yet to windes and whirlewindes of falſe doctrine, how could it bee able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and ſtand, if together with the worde of God, it had not for the ordering and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof, her diſcipline, to be as it were a rampart, ground worke, foundation and ſtay?

                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.17.</note> and to bring them to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Magiſtrate draweth out, and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his materiall ſwoord, to puniſhe them
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3532:134"/> either in their goods, or in their bodies.</p>
               <p>And ſo both of them doe their duetie, the one of them not bringing any prejudice or hurt to the other, but contrariwiſe, verye well aiding them ſelues betweene them ſelues, and helping one another, and being moſt neceſſarie and needfull in their ſeuerall charges and offices, the one not being able, to doe that which the other doth. One ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to make the matter plaine. If ſome one haue committed whordome, and ſo by that meanes and fault, the ciuill lawes ſhall be tranſgreſſed and broken, and the church alſo offended: Nowe in reformed Courtes and places of lawe, ſuch a one ſhall bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed either by impriſonment, or by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or by ſome other puniſhment: and ſo the offender, ſhall haue ſatisfied the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates lawes, but yet the offence ſhall not be repaired or reformed in the Church. For it may bee, that ſuche an euill doer will in ſteede of giuing or ſhewing ſome ſigne of repentaunce, murmur, bee angrie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitefully deale with the Churche. In ſuch a caſe the Churche, before that it receiueth him to the holy Supper, ſhall require of him, a publike teſtimonie and open token of his repentaunce, and by conſequent, as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3532:134"/> the Magiſtrate ſhal haue his iuſtice ſatisfied and anſwered, ſo ſhall the Church haue her diſcipline ſatisfied and anſwered. In ſumme, the Magiſtrate in the exerciſing and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his office, reſpecteth mens goods &amp; their bodies, but the Church in the exerciſe and execution of her diſcipline, regardeth ſimplie and onely, the ſoules and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſo farre off is it, that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, derogateth or taketh any thing at all away from the Magiſtrate, that contrariwiſe ſhe maintaineth the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that is due vnto him. For if ſhe tend to no other end, or ſhoot at no other mark, but to cauſe vs to practiſe that, which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the word of God, and ſo it is that Gods worde teacheth vs to ſubmitte our ſelues, &amp; to yeeld our ſelues ſubiect,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.<hi>1. &amp;</hi> Tit. 3.1.</note> to our Magiſtrates, <hi>and that not for feare of wrath onely, but alſo for conſcience ſake,</hi> who ſeeth not this that ſhe is eſtabliſhed and ſet vp by God, to maintaine the Magiſtrate in his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, &amp; to cauſe that obedience to bee rendred and yelded to him, which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto him.</p>
               <p>And alſo this is to bee noted, that the church hath not any particular member or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3532:135"/> perſon in it, which ſhe doth not moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make ſubiect to the magiſtrate, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing therein that which S. Paul ſaith: <hi>Let euery ſoule</hi> (that is to ſay,?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1.</note> euery perſon or man) <hi>bee ſubiect vnto the higher powers.</hi> Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the Prieſtes, Friers, &amp; Monkes of the Romiſh churche, and in ſumme, all thoſe of the Popes Cleargie, ſhoulde heere verie well take them ſelues by the noſe, that if it may be, they may be aſhamed, and ſo come to repentance. For whereas they reproue and accuſe vs, to be rebels to our Superiors, I woulde wiſh them to looke to them ſelues, and to marke howe farre they ſhewe themſelues obedient, and by what title and right they can boaſt them ſelues to bee exempted from all ſuche ſubiection. It may bee, that they will not beleeue Saint Paules words without the interpretation of ſom of the fathers, let them then well looke to, and mark, that which Chryſoſtome hath written vpon this place, whoſe wordes are very cleare and plaine.<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in 13. cap. ad Roman.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Apoſtle ſpeaketh thus</hi> (ſaith Chryſoſtome) <hi>Let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that this commaundement is directed to all, yea to Prieſtes and Monkes, and not onely to them, which are buſied and occupied

               </p>
               <p>The thirde head or point is, that for the exerciſing and executing of the diſcipline, there muſt be in the Churche a Conſiſtorie, that is to ſay, an aſſemblie or a Councell, compacted &amp; made of the miniſters and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to watch ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſolencies, breakings
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3532:136"/> out and offences, which may fall amongeſt the members of the Church. This conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was heretofore in vſe among the Iewes, and was called Synedrion and Presbyterie. Nowe if when corruption burſt into the Church, men abuſed both the title, and the right and lawfull vſe of the Conſiſtorie, it followeth not for all that, that Ieſus Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, woulde haue it aboliſhed, but rather haue brought it backe againe to his former ſafetie and ſoundneſſe, and vſed the ſame, when the time was for it. This is that which Saint Paul meaneth, when wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto the Romanes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8.</note> hee ſaith: <hi>Let him that ruleth, doe it with diligence.</hi> For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that hee ſpeaketh not to Magiſtrates, but hee ſpeaketh to the Elders, Ancients, and ouerwatchers, who were ioined to and with the Paſtours, for the ruling and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Church. Alſo, when he ſaith to Timothie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Tim. 5.17</note> 
                  <hi>The Elders that rule well, are worthie double honour, ſpecially they whiche labour in the worde and doctrine.</hi> For hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth there two ſortes of Ancients or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſome that trauell in the word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſuch are the Paſtours and Miniſters, and other ſome, which exerciſe an other charge, as the Elders, or as wee ſay, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchers,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3532:136"/> who are appointed to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to, and to watch ouer the manners of the people.</p>
               <p>But to make this point more plaine: we muſt ſpeake yet ſomewhat more thereof. S. Paule writing to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.6.7.8.</note> diuideth the functions or offices of the Church into two ſortes or kindes, that is, into the office of Prophetes, and into the office of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as in an other place,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> he maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Biſhops &amp; Deacons, according to the example of the Apoſtles. Acts. 6.2.3. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Againe, hee diuideth theſe two kindes or ſortes, into certaine other. Of Prophets hee maketh two rankes or orders: ſome he calleth Paſtours, and the other Doctours, whoſe charge and office is, to labour in the worde and doctrine, as we haue heretofore ſufficiently declared in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Of Deacons, hee maketh three kindes. Some giue themſelues wholy to the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and diſtributions of the almes, which properly indeede are called Deacons. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome are they to whome ſpecially and chiefly this charge belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, to watch ouer
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3532:137"/> the maners of the flocke, and ouer ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as may fall out amongeſt them, and theſe are properly called Ancients, Elders, and ouerwatchers. The third ſorte, are they which haue a ſpeciall care of the ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about them, to take care ouer them, and to vſe them courteouſly, gently, and well, and ſuch were heretofore the widdowes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim</hi> 5.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> whereof mention is made in the ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Touching which matter this is to bee marked, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſucceſſion &amp; proceſſe of time, certaine Councels and Synods ordained, that women ſhould bee no more admitted into ſuch offices and charges of Diaconeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; this was done to the end, they might meete withall and preuent all inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; offences riſing thereon: in the place and ſteede of whiche women Diaconeſſes, the like adminiſtration &amp; office, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to and laide vpon men, lawfully choſen and called thereto.</p>
               <p>Now marke how theſe offices and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, be at this day exerciſed and vſed in the reformed Churches. As concerning the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Doctors, they handle, intreate on, and expound the worde, as we haue ſaid, &amp; ſhewed before in the ninth Chapter, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3532:137"/> and Deacons not any maner of way medling therewith.</p>
               <p>There are two other companies or ſortes. The one is called the aſſemblie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, which haue care of the poore: the other the Conſiſtorie: Both in the one and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the paſtors are vſually to be found and had, as well to make publike prayer, as to giue aduiſe and counſell, touching y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ought to be done.</p>
               <p>In the aſſemblie or company which haue care of the poore, they take aduiſe &amp; order, for collections and diſtributions, for aide and aſſiſtance to be giuen to the poore, and that the ſicke and diſeaſed may be holpen and ſuccoured. And then are preſent with the Deacons, ſo many of the Miniſters and Elders, yea and of other citizens and towne dwellers, or pariſhioners, as occaſion and neceſſitie requireth.</p>
               <p>The Conſiſtorie is compoſed, made, and conſiſteth, of the Paſtors and Elders, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo are admitted and receiued the Doctors and Deacons, ſo farre foorth, and in as much as they ſhall iudge it to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and profitable, to aduiſe, giue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and conſider of the Cenſures, and of that which is requiſite and neceſſarie, for
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3532:138"/> the guiding and gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the church.</p>
               <p>Therefore of this companie is it that wee ſpeake, to which wee ſay appertaineth the ſpirituall gouernement of the Church. And indeede it appeareth that the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche was gouerned and guyded after this manner, by the Apoſtles, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the Elders, who altogether aſſembled and met together, ſo often, as there was neede of ſuch an aſſemblie to be had. For it is ſaide in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that the Church of Antioch, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to haue aduiſe and iudgement, in a difficult and hard queſtion concerning do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">Act. 15.2</note> did ſend to <hi>the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church of Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled and met together. Alſo that the Elders of Ieruſalem were aſſembled and met together, when Iames was, to take counſell of that which Saint Paule had to doe,<note place="margin">Act. <hi>21.</hi>18.</note> touching the purging and cleering of himſelfe, from the ſlaunders that were laid vpon him, and giuen out againſt him. And wee ſee alſo whither Ieſus Chriſte ſendeth the offenders, who are ſtiffe, &amp; not yeelding to a confeſſion of their fault, when he ſaith: <hi>Tell it vnto the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17</note> For by the Church
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3532:138"/> there hee meaneth no other thing, but the Conſiſtorie, that is to ſay, the gouernours and guiders of the Church, euen as Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome hath expounded it, as wee haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerued it, and put it downe in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, it is very manifeſt &amp; plaine, that there muſt be in the Church Ancients or ouerwatchers, appointed to this end, to watch ouer the manners of the people, and who alſo together with the Paſtors, muſt looke to the exerciſe and execution of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline that the church may be wel guided and gouerned.</p>
               <p>The fourth head or point is,<note place="margin">Of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and cenſures of the Church.</note> touching the corrections, and cenſures of the church. Wee haue ſaide, that in euery church there ought to be a Conſiſtorie, to exerciſe and execute the diſcipline. Now wee adde, that this ought to be found true, and declared ſpecially in the corrections and cenſures. Whereupon we haue certaine conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to bee obſerued and marked.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that wee muſt make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene ſecret faults, &amp; thoſe which are publike and open, that wee may applie thereto meete and conuenient cenſures. I call them ſecret faults which are knowne
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3532:139"/> to one alone, or to very fewe perſons. And I call them publike and open faultes, which are notorious and manifeſtly knowne of euery one, or els of very many men. If then the faultes be ſecret, wee muſt follow in the correction and amendment therof, the rule which is preſcribed by Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15.</note> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew 18. where it is ſaid, <hi>If thy brother offend or ſinne againſt thee, goe tell him thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thee and him alone, &amp;c.</hi> But if the faults be publike and open, we muſt follow the commandement and example of Saint Paul.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.20.</note> His commandement is this: <hi>Suche as offend, reproue openly, that the reſt alſo may feare.</hi> His example is, in that when S. Peter had committed an offenſiue fault, hee did not warne him thereof apart,<note place="margin">Gala. 2.14.</note> or by himſelf, but did reproue him openly, &amp; that before the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond conſideration is, that among open faults and offences, there are ſome whiche are leſſe than otherſome are, and therefore diſcretion and iudgement ought to be vſed in the cenſuring thereof. But all the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances cannot be eaſily expreſſed, wherefore the Conſiſtorie ought to bee wiſe, &amp; of good iudgement, to practiſe the admonition and warning of Saint Iude<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iude.</hi> 22.23.</note>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:3532:139"/> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith: <hi>Haue compaſſion of ſome in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting difference: &amp; other ſome ſaue with feare, pulling them out of the fire.</hi> For amongeſt faults, ſome deſerue, but ſimple or bare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition alone: otherſom ſuſpention from the holy ſupper, others excommunication, and other, ſome other cenſure. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceiued in this what ſo euer it bee, in following &amp; doing that which the worde of God commaundeth vs, that is to ſay, to cut off from the church rebellious &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent perſons, alſo faultie perſons,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.<hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> whiche ſtand ſtiffe in their faultes, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heretikes.</p>
               <p>The thirde conſideration is: that when the queſtion is of Cenſures, and namely of cutting off from the vſe of the Supper, or of excommunication, one alone ſhould not take vpon him the knowledge thereof, but it is neceſſarie and meete, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church ſhould bee interpoſed or come betweene. For one man alone, whatſoeuer graces hee hath receiued from God, cannot, or ought not to attribute vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe ſuche an authoritie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. Paul being willing to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the inceſtuous perſon, ſaith thus:<note place="margin">1, Cor. <hi>5.</hi>3.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as abſent in body, but preſent in ſpirit, haue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3532:140"/> determined alredie, as though I were preſent, that he that hath thus done this thing, when yee are gathered together and my ſpirite, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ſuch a one I ſay, by the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, be deliuered vnto Satan, &amp;c.</hi> Although hee was an Apoſtle, yet hee alone and of his owne authoritie, doth not cut off from the Church this inceſtuous perſon, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his aduice &amp; order, to &amp; with the Churche, to the ende that the matter might be done by common authoritie and conſent.</p>
               <p>And indeede in olde time this was the common and vſuall maner, to wit, that the Eccleſiaſticall cenſures, ſhoulde bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Tertul. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logeti. ca. 39.</note> by the Conſiſtorie. For as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Apologetike, or defenſiue wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Tertullian, if queſtion ſhoulde bee had, touching them that ought to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, or of them that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted certaine faults, whether they ought to bee receiued or no, this authoritie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to the Miniſters and Elders of the Churche, who ordinarily and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſſembled and met together, for that purpoſe and matter. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3532:140"/> or publiſhing of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or the caſting of one our, or the publike receiuing of him, againe before the Churche, was done by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour.</p>
               <p>In this ſorte Origen ordaineth,<note place="margin">Origen in Iohan. Hom. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> that hee whiche hath beene three times ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, and yet afterwardes amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, ſhoulde bee cut off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the Church, by the gouernors of the Church</p>
               <p>And Saint Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cypri. lib. <hi>3.</hi> epiſt. 10.<hi>14.</hi> &amp; <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> making mention of the cuſtom and manner vſed in his time, touching the publike and open cenſures of the Churche, ſaith, that nothing at all was done by the Biſhoppe, without the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Clergie, and the conſent of the people. Wherefore the Pope of Rome declareth him ſelfe to bee a falſe dealer, and indeede a Tyrant, when ſnatching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that by violence, from the Church the right and power that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth thereto, hee arrogateth to himſelf and to his, power &amp; authoritie, to cut off from the Churche, and to exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate whom ſo euer hee, or any of them ſhall thinke good.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:3532:141"/>
               <p>The fourth conſideration is, touching the ends, which men ought to ſet before them, in the corrections of the church, &amp; namely in excommunication. Now there are three ſpeciall endes thereof.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that thoſe which be of wicked life and conuerſation, may not haue anye place amongeſt true Chriſtians to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods name.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that good people may not bee corrupted by the conuerſation of the wicked,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Cor. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>for a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe.</hi>

               <p>But the Emperor Theodoſius was better
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3532:143"/> aduiſed, and of a more godly minde. For we reade that when Saint Ambroſe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated him,<note place="margin">Ambr. lib. 1. epiſt. 8. in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio. Theodoſu.</note> by reaſon of much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, which was ſpilt and ſhead at his commandement, he tooke ſuche a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in good part, and ſo far off was it, that hee was ſtubborne and ſelfe willed againſte his Paſtor and his Elders, to recoyle backe againe, or to with drawe himſelfe from the Churche, that on the other ſide, approuing the ſame correction and cenſure, hee vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed himſelfe of his kingly ornaments, and openly bewailing his ſinne in the Churche, hee did with teares, gronings, and ſighes, demaund and aske forgiueneſſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Certainly this is not in vaine, that Ieſus chriſt hath ſaid to the paſtors of his church: <hi>Whatſoeuer yee ſhall bind or looſe in earth ſhal be bound or looſed in heauen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18.<hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> For thereby hee hath authoriſed his church, in the vſe of the keyes, by the worde of God, to condemne the peruerſe, ſtubborne and vngodly, and by the ſame word to reconcile, and receiue to mercie, all true penitent ſinners. Which authoritie of the Churche, is not reſtrained or hedged in, to bee exerciſed and executed among the common people only, but alſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3532:143"/> vpon Lordes and Magiſtrates. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it followeth, that none can diſtract or withdrawe himſelfe therefrom, but hee renounceth and forſaketh the meane of his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The concluſion is this: that ſeeing God hath ordeined correction and diſcipline, to the end that wee ſhould profite &amp; grow vp in his doctrine, &amp; that we ſhoulde not be hardned in our ſins, but rather that they might be reproued, to the end they might not ingender and worke in vs an vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rottenneſſe or infection, It followeth that they which flie and refuſe the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and cenſures of the Church, which are made and giuen them in the name of God, refuſe God himſelfe, &amp; deſpiſe their owne ſaluation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether it belong to the Church to make lawes? and if ſhe make ſome, how farre the faithfull ought to obey her.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen the queſtion is of the lawes of the Church, wee knowe that ſom concerne the doctrine, vnder which wee comprehende the Sacramentes alſo, and other the diſcipline or pollicie, and order, that is to ſay, the faſhion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing. The lawes which concerne doctrine, touch the conſcience, and in the knowledge and practiſe of them, ſtandeth the ſeruice &amp; worſhip of God, &amp; our own ſaluation. Of this ſort are al the points &amp; articles of doctrine, conteined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, which we muſt beleeue and obſerue, without adding any thing thereto, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing therfrom in changing it. Thoſe which concerne the diſcipline, are to bee referred to the order and honeſtie, which ought to be kept in the church, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in a maner &amp; faſhion of doing, altogether outward, and theſe may a man call indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which a man may vſe either well or euill, of this ſort are ordinaunces tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3532:144"/> the places, the times, the ſeaſons, &amp; the houres, ſet for preachings &amp; miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments, the celebration of marriages, faſts, publik praiers, &amp; ſuch like things: yet notwithſtanding this muſt be knowne, that no man may appoint in the practiſe and perfourmance of theſe matters, the ſeruice of God, or our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither muſt any man thinke, that of themſelues they concerne the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Nowe the difference and diſputation that ſome moue and make in the Church touching this matter, is not as concerning this laſte kinde of Lawes, appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning only to the diſcipline or pollicie. So euery one knoweth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth, that the church cannot want her pollicie &amp; order and that, to the end ſhee may abide vnited and tyed together, ſhee hath neede of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain outward bonds: wherfore the church may without any difficulti or doubt, make lawes apperteining only to the outwarde diſcipline, and take them away, or change them, according as ſhe ſhal iudge them to be expedient &amp; profitable, hauing alwaies ſpeciall reſpect to the times, places, and perſons. As for example, the church may
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:3532:145"/> ordeine &amp; appoint ſome day of the week for publike praiers, whether the prayers be ordinary or extraordinary: the Churche alſo may choſe a certaine day, or a certaine houre, to giue thankes vnto God when it ſhall haue pleaſed him, to haue deliuered out of ſome greate daunger either the whole Churche, or the Countrie, or the Magiſtrate, or ſome other members pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in authoritie: the Churche alſo may publiſh a faſt, ſo often as neceſſitie and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall require. It may take order al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that Baptiſme be miniſtred at a certaine time after the preachings: that the holy Supper be celebrated and miniſtred ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a yeere, and at thoſe ſeaſons, which they ſhall iudge expedient and meete: that the as kings or publiſhing of the banes of marriage, ſhoulde bee as it were proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med or declared three ſeuerall Sundaies! And laſtly that the ſaide marriages ſhould bee celebrated at the Sermons or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, either in the morning or eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: that the conſiſtories for the maners of the people, and the aſſemblie or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany which haue care for the poore, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and meete together ſo often in a moneth, as ſhall bee found expedient, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3532:145"/> profitable.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Churche may eſtabliſh theſe lawes, and other ſuch like, which the faithful ought to obey, to the ende that there may not be any diſorder, or any con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſion among the people of God.</p>
               <p>But the queſtion is of lawes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doctrine, and the Sacraments, or els other lawes touching the diſcipline, by which they woulde binde conſciences, &amp; incloſe and comprehende therein ſimplie the ſeruice of God, that is to ſay, whether it belong to the Churche to make Lawes thereof or no? The Romiſh Catholikes, ſay they may, and wee affirme the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, and theſe are their reaſons follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this: The Church hath authoritie to teach: wherefore ſhe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo authoritie to make lawes, belonging to the doctrine or teaching.</p>
               <p>But this argument may be ouerthrown in two wordes, if we denie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence For theſe be matters very much differing, to wit, to haue authoritie to teache, and to haue authoritie to make Lawes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the doctrine. Ieſus Chriſte hath in deede giuen the firſt of theſe to his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3532:146"/> church: but ſo hee hath not the ſeconde. And as God hath expreſſely forbidden, to add any thing vnto his law,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.2.<hi>12.32.</hi>
                  </note> ſo Ieſus Chriſt hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his diſciples, to teach only the doctrine which they had heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon. The church hath the vſe of the keies, &amp; can bind and looſe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. Wherfore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that ſhee hath alſo authorie to eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſhe lawes apperteining to the doctrine.</p>
               <p>I anſwere in one worde, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is falſe as it was in the argument laſt before going: for a Lorde or Ruler will in deed giue power and authoritie to his offi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cers to abſolue &amp; to condemne according to the lawes &amp; ordinances, but yet it will not folow for al that, that he giueth them power, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to make new lawes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his people, &amp; to iudge by them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own fantaſie. So Ieſus Chriſt hath in deed giuen vnto his apoſtles &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples, this power, to binde, &amp; to looſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his lawes, but this is ill conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſay that therefore he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this power &amp; this authoritie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to make lawes, &amp; to eſtabliſhe them in his
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3532:146"/> Church, and thereby to binde mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes ſeat: all therefore whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue &amp; do:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</note> And the Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrwes, <hi>Obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue the ouerſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Wherfore it followeth, that we ought to obey the Paſtors of the Church in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and obſeruing their lawes.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that when wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obey our Paſtors, this ought to be vnderſtood, ſo farre foorth as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements proceede and come out of Moſes chaire, that is to ſay, out of the word of God. For otherwiſe the Lord proteſteth and openly witneſſeth, that hee is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped in vain, when men ſet out, and preach for doctrine, the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of men.<note place="margin">Matth. <hi>15.</hi>9.</note> And he himſelf doth ſtraightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand vs earneſtly to take heed &amp; beware of the lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen of the Phariſes &amp; Saduces. Touching which matter,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>16.6</hi> August. in Iohn. Tracta. <hi>46.</hi> Cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> let vs heare Sainte Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine. <hi>The Scribes</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and the Phariſees ſitte in Moſes ſeate, doe that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they ſhall ſhew vnto you. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3532:147"/> ſet in the chaire or ſeate of Moſes, they teach the law of God, and ſo God teacheth by them.</hi> But if they would teach any thing of their owne, heare them not, and doe not that which they will ſay: for they ſeek their owne profite and gaine, and not Chriſtes profite. In ſumme then, if the Churche make &amp; ordeine for vs commaundements drawen and taken from the word of god, it is our duetie to receiue them, and to yeelde our ſelues obedient thereto: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. For it is not the Churches du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to goe beyond the boundes of Gods worde, in making lawes of her owne head and authoritie, &amp; inuenting new faſhions and maners to ſerue God by. And the rule of our obedience ought alwaies to be the very ſelfe ſame worde of God: as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius ſaide vnto Saint Peter.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 10.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Now are we al heere preſent before God, to heare all thinges which are commaunded thee of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon, wee muſt obey the voice of the Churche,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.17. Luke. <hi>10.</hi>16.</note> as wee haue a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement giuen vs therfore in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. But the lawes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the church, are the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches voice, wherefore it followeth that we muſt obey the lawes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the church.</p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:3532:147"/>
               <p>I aunſwere, as aboue is aunſwered, that wee muſt obeye the voyce of the Church, when it commeth out of Moyſes chaire and ſeate: that is to ſay, when her commaundementes ſhalbe taken and ſet from the word of God: and when alſo the queſtion ſhall bee of thinges indifferent, which ſhee ſhall ordeine and eſtabliſh, to keepe good order, &amp; to ſerue for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the maintenance and vpholding of the diſcipline: For in the things which are contrarie to Gods worde, and in thoſe alſo which of them ſelues are indifferent, but yet become and made euill thorowe ſuperſtition, to wit, becauſe that in them, they would place the ſeruice of God, and that they would think by them, to deſerue Gods grace, and the forgiuenes of ſinnes, in theſe thinges I ſay, we ought not at any hand to obey,<note place="margin">Acts. 4.19.<hi>5.29.</hi>
                  </note> but in ſuch commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the Church, wee ought to ſay, <hi>that it is better to obey God then men.</hi>

               <p>The fift reaſon:<note place="margin">Eſter. 9.26.<hi>27</hi>
                  </note> As in Eſter it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined, that beſides the feaſtes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the lawe, they ſhould celebrate eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeare the feaſt of lottes, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Purim:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Macha.</hi> 4.59.</note> and in the hiſtorie of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees, the feaſt of the dedication, called

                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Encaenia:</hi> So the Chriſtian church may well at this day or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine feaſtes, as ſhall ſeeme vnto her to be expedient and profitable for the glorie of God, and the edification of the people: as it hath in time heretofore ordeined the feaſtes and holie dayes of ſaint Peter, of ſaint Anthonie, of ſaint Marcellus, of ſaint Margaret, and all the reſt.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there is no likeneſſe at all, betweene the feaſtes of <hi>Purim,</hi> or lots, and of the dedication, and theſe of ſaint Peter, ſaint Anthonie, and ſuch others. I deny not, but that thoſe two firſt, were in former time eſtabliſhed by the church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the feaſtes ordeined in the lawe: but let vs marke I pray you, howe, and to what ende. Certeinly this was for the glorie of God, &amp; to bring to their remembrance his great benefites, towardes his church, that they alſo might giue him thanks ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore. For in Eſter it is ſaide, that the feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> or lottes, was ordeined by the church, for remembraunce of this, that the people was deliuered from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſpiracie of Haman. And Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Machabeus, with the conſent of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3532:148"/> whole church ordeined, the feaſt of the dedication, otherwiſe called <hi>Encaenia,</hi> in remembraunce of the deliueraunce of the people, and of the repairing, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing againe, as it were, of the Temple, which had beene polluted by Antiochus. And wee deny not but that Synodes, may ordein certain dayes, and ſolemnely keepe them, to the end that the people may ceaſe from their own workes, to faſt to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to yeeld him thankes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as things ſhall fall out, &amp; occaſion be miniſtred, ſo that it be don without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, idolatrie, or euill example. But how can we, by the examples of the two feaſtes aforeſaide, approue or allowe the feaſtes of the Papacie or Popedome? Firſt they were but two onely. But in the Popedom, there is an infinit number. For what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure did they euer keepe in the number thereof? Secondly, the two aboue ſpoken of, were inſtituted to the name of God, and at no hande to the name of any dead Saints. But theſe are ordeined to the name of creatures, and not to the name of God, as we heare, they cal them, the feaſtes of S. Anthony, of S. Frauncis, of Saint Vincent, of Saint Sebaſtian, of Saint Agathon,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3532:149"/> of the virgine Mary, and ſo of others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thoſe had their foundation and beginning for the ſeruice of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſerued to edification, for they were eſtabliſhed and appointed (as hath beene ſaid) to thank God, &amp; to giue him praiſe, for the benefits which hee had beſtowed vpon his Church. Theſe had no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or beginning, but in ſuperſtition and idolatrie, &amp; ſerue to no other purpoſe or matter, either more or leſſe, than the feaſtes and holie dayes of the Paganes and Ethnickes. For wherfore is it, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes giue the names of Saintes to their feaſtiuall dayes, but becauſe they meane, to ſanctifie the ſaide feaſtes, in the honour of thoſe Saintes (as they call them) whoſe name they beare? And in ſo doing, do they not ſet vp the Saintes in Gods place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſerue &amp; giue that honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which apperteineth to him alone, as in olde time the Paganes did in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of their feaſtes and diuine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices?</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principall reaſons vpon which the Romiſhe Catholikes grounde them ſelues, thereby to proue, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Church, to make lawes to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3532:149"/> tye mens conſciences withall. Nowe it remaineth, that wee ſhewe and ſet downe our reaſons, to proue the contrarie.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this: It is written in Iſaiah:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 33.22</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is our Iudge: the Lord is our lawe giuer: the Lord is our King.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 4.<hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> And in Saint Iames. <hi>There is one lawe giuer which is able to ſaue and deſtroy:</hi> whereby it is verie clearely ſeene, that it belongeth to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to make Eccleſiaſticall lawes, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon: There is none but God alone, that can inſtitute and ordeine a lawfull ſeruice, which may be agreeable to himſelfe, and acceptable in his ſight, for this cauſe he him ſelfe ſaieth:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut. 12.</hi>8.32.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee ſhall not doe after all theſe thinges, that yee doe heere this day: that is, euery man whatſoeuer ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good in his owne eyes: but whatſoeuer I commaund you, take heed yee do it: thou ſhalt put nothing thereto, nor take ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</hi> And in Ieremiah.<note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>I ſpake not (ſaieth he) vnto your fathers, nor commaunded them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and ſacrifices: but this thing I commanded them, ſaying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and yee ſhal be my people, and walke yee in all the wayes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3532:150"/> which I haue commaunded you, that it may be well vnto you.</hi> He ſaieth alſo by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Samuell:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Sam.</hi> 15.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Thinkeſt thou, that the Lord hath as great pleaſure in burnt offerings and ſacrifices, as when his voice is obeyed? Behold to obey, is better than ſacrifice: and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is better then the fatte of Rammes.</hi> Wee may read, many ſuch or the lyke ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, but ſpecially this is notable and excellent, that the ſonnes of Aaron were horribly burned and conſumed with the fire which was ſent out from the Lord,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 10.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe they offered ſtraunge fire, and which in deede, was not commaunded them. But wee adde, that the lawes which concerne doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and by which mens conſciences are tied apperteine to the ſeruice of God. And therfore it foloweth, that there is none but God alone which can make and eſtabliſh ſuch lawes.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon: Lawes concerning doctrine, and ſuch as binde mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ought to bee vnto vs a teſtimony &amp; pledge, of the wil of God: But God alone by his word can giue vnto vs this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and at no hand or by no meanes, men, as of them ſelues,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. <hi>40.13</hi> &amp;c. Rom. <hi>11.</hi>34.</note> 
                  <hi>For who hath inſtructed the ſpirite of the Lord? or was his Counſellor, or taught him? as the ſcripture ſaith:</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3532:150"/> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that God alone, may make &amp; eſtabliſh lawes concerning doctrine, and which ſhal ſerue to binde mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon: If it belong to the Church, to make lawes concerning doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, &amp; the ſeruice of god, this muſt needs be, that ſhe hath receiued the prerogatiue and authoritie, from God him ſelf, for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not here in their life, any power ſo to doe. But ſo it is, that the Church hath not receiued from God this prerogatiue &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, God hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; plainly forbidden them, to ioyne or adde any thing to his lawe.<note place="margin">Deut. <hi>4.2.</hi>12.32.</note> Wherefore it followeth, that it doeth not apperteine to her, to make lawes touching doctrine and the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>The fift reaſon. It is neceſſary, that they which make lawes ſhoulde haue Lordſhip, rule &amp; authoritie ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom they giue thoſe lawes. But the church hath no Lordſhip, or rule, ouer the conſciences of the faithful:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet. 5.3.</note> for S. Peter ſpeketh with a loud voice &amp; plainly, <hi>That the Paſtors &amp; Biſhops haue not any Lordſhippe ouer the Lordes inheritance, that is to ſay, ouer the faithful, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church is compoſed &amp; made.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. 1.4.</note> And S. Paul plainly proteſteth: touching himſelf, that hee hath not any dominion ouer the faith of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:3532:151"/>
               <p>Wherefore it followeth, that the Church may not make or eſtabliſh lawes, to binde the conſciences of faithfull people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.</note>The ſixt reaſon: The Lorde ſaieth: <hi>In vaine they worſhip mee, teaching for doctrine mens precepts and commaundements:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> And S. Paul calleth lawes &amp; traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, touching forbidding of marriage, and vſe of meats, <hi>the doctrine of Deuils.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 2.16.18.</note> Alſo he ſaieth: <hi>Let no man condemne you in meate and drinke, or in reſpect of an holy day, &amp;c. Let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at his pleaſure beare rule ouer you, by humblenes of minde, and worſhipping of Angels.</hi> By theſe ſentences, it is moſt plaine and euident, that the Church ought not, nor may not eſtabliſh any ſuch lawes, to binde, tye, or reſtraine mens conſciences.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth reaſon. The lawes which take away from vs, that Chriſtian libertie which Chriſt hath gotten and purchaſed for vs, ought not in any caſe to be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed or tollerated. For S. Paule exhorteth vs,<note place="margin">Galat. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſtande faſt in the libertie wherewith Chriſt hath made vs free, and that we ſhould not be intangled againe with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But the lawes giuen by men &amp; not from God him ſelfe, touching matters, which are commended vnto vs, with an
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3532:151"/> opinion of neceſſitie, and which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs, as workes meritorious, or as the ſeruice of God, take away from vs the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie and freedome which Chriſte hath purchaſed for vs: of this ſort are the lawes made, touching the obſeruation and keeping of Lent, celebration or keeping ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of certaine feaſts, not to eate fleſhe, vpon Friday, Saturday, and certaine other dayes: and ſuch like things. Wherfore it foloweth, that ſuch lawes ought not in any caſe to be eſtabliſhed, ſet vp, tollerated, or borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>But wee wil make or put an ende to this Chapter, with two ſentences which make altogether for vs, &amp; are altogether againſte the Romiſhe Catholikes.<note place="margin">Tho. Aqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Church is founded alreadie and grounded in the faith and in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it doth not belong to the Miniſters of the Churche, to make newe Articles of faith, or newe Sacraments, or to take away thoſe which are alreadie made and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For this is the excellencie and power, which belongeth onely vnto Ieſus Chriſte, who is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the church.

From hence is it, that euen from the beginning of the world enmities betweene the faithfull, and the aduerſaries of the truth, haue taken and had their originall and firſt foundation. This is the cauſe why Cain ſlue his brother Abell: that Lot the faithfull ſeruant of the Lord, was hated of the Sodomites, that Iſhmael mocked Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac, and perſecuted him: that Eſau went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to oppreſſe and kill Iacob, euen from his youth: that Ioſeph had his owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for his enimies: that the Prophetes could not agree with the wicked Kinges: nor Saint Iohn Baptiſt, with the inceſtuous Herode, nor Ieſus Chriſte with the high Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees, nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Martyrs, with the infidels and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers of their times.

And ſo the fire continued in the Citie ſixe dayes ſpace, which made ſuch a deſtruction, that he became hereby very odious among the people. And ſeeing that hee could not put out this hatred, and waiting of him to doe him ſome miſchiefe for all the good turnes which hee could do to the people, he found out this deuiſe to ſowe abrode this bruite, rumor and report, that it was the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had been the blowers of that fire, and the authours of that deſtruction, and from that time forward, he began to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, and to put them to death, both becauſe they were (as hee ſaid) the blowers of that fyre, and alſo becauſe they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all mankinde, by reaſon of that confeſſion which they made of the name of Chriſt.

               <p>The 2. perſecution was vnder <hi>Domitian</hi> the 12. Emperour, who was appointed Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in the yeere of Chriſte 83. and reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned 15. yeers and 6. monethes. Hee was ſo lifed vp in crueltie and pride that he would haue his ſubiects call him God and Lord, and cauſed images of his owne perſon to bee made of gold and ſiluer. Hee ordeined (as his father <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> had doone before him) that inquirie ſhoulde bee made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the race of Dauid, and that they which were founde to bee thereof, ſhoulde bee put to death, for hee feared the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſte, and about the fourteenth yeere of his reigne, and the yeere of Chriſte 97. hee cauſed by an edict to bee publiſhed,

               <p>The third perſecution, was in the dayes of <hi>Traian,</hi> the fourteenth Emperour, who was appointed Emperour about the yeere of Chriſte 100. who gouerned the Empire nineteene yeeres, ſixe monethes, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes. Hee is greatly praiſed of the Hiſtoriographers, as a courteous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Prince: and ſome ſay that hee was ſo renowmed and famous, by reaſon of his iuſtice, and curteſie, that euer after ſo often as any was created Emperour, the people yeelded this bleſſed exclamation, outcrie, and conſent: Bee hee more happy then <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and better then <hi>Traian,</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee perſecuted the Churche, and marke the occaſion that he tooke ſo to doe.

Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror &amp; created about the yeere of Chriſt 182.) vntill <hi>Seuerus</hi> came, who in the ix. yeere of his raigne (which was after <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> account in the yeere of Chriſte 205.) moued &amp; ſtirred vp a terrible perſecution againſt the chriſtians, by the gouerners of the Prouinces and countries. And ſome thinke, that hee was moued therto, rather by the vices &amp; faultes, which the furious common people, did very faſly and wrong fully lay to the Chriſtians charge, then to ſay that of himſelfe hee had his hearte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:3532:163"/>
               <p>Tertullian who was in his time, ſaith,<note place="margin">Tertullian, ad ſcapul.</note> that hee ſhewed him ſelfe for a certaine time, not onely curteous, gentle, and full of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence, liberalitie and good will, but alſo did openly reſiſt the rage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet Euſebius proueth by diuers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Martyrs, that this Emperour was a terrible perſecutor of the Church.</p>
               <p>Touching the crimes falſly obiected &amp; alledged, againſt the Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Tertul. ad Scapu. &amp; in Apologet.</note> Tertullian reciteth diuers of them, ſaying: That they were accuſed of ſedition and treaſon: that they had blamed and ſpoken euill of the Emperour his honor: that they were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, Church robbers, inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, killers of infantes, which they did eate, the fleſh being rawe: that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted whordome without hauing reſpect with whom, after that they had put out the candles, with which filthineſſe, the Gnoſtici, were in deed ſpotted. Alſo that they worſhipped the head of an Aſſe, in the ſteede of God: that they worſhipped the Sunne: that they were in nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for others: that they were enemies of mankinde, and the greateſt and chiefeſt crime that they laid againſt them, or vpon
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3532:164"/> them, was this, that they deſpiſed the gods which other men worſhipped.</p>
               <p>And touching the ſortes and maners of torments, we may gather it out of that which Euſebius hath written of it:<note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> that ſome were buffetted and beaten: other ſome beheaded, others burned: others had boyling pitch powred, ouer all the members of their bodies, and ſo they were by litle and litle burned and put to death: and beſides all this, that all their goods were pilled away, robbed, and confiſcate.</p>
               <p>The ſixt perſecution, was vnder Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Maximianus, the xxvi. Emperour, who ſucceeded Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, in the yeare of Chriſt, 237. &amp; reigned onely about three yeares. Hee was a ſheepeheard in his young age, but becauſe hee was a great and mightie man, beeing a Souldier, hee was created Emperour without any authoritie of the Senate, but by the onely good will and pleaſure of the Souldiers &amp; warlike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Hee beeing cruell, barbarous, and rude, mooued great perſecution againſt the Chriſtians, but namely and chieflly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctours, teachers, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3532:164"/> of the Churches, ſuppoſing, that when theſe men, who were (as it were) the pillers of Chriſtian religion, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, the people would thereby bee eaſilie turned away. Euſebius ſaieth,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 6. Cap. 28.</note> that this Emperour was not kindled and ſet on fire, to execute this crueltie: but onely for hatred which hee beare, to Alexanders ſtocke and houſe, wherein there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians: But he had not any great leaſure or time to exerciſe his crueltie: for before he had reigned three whole yeares, he was ſlaine of his ſouldiers, and with him his ſonne, who was nineteene yeares olde, and their bodies were caſt into the Riuer.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth perſecution, was vnder the Emperour Decius, about the yeare of Chriſt, 247. Euſebius reciteth,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. 6. Cap. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> that this perſecution was mooued by Decius, becauſe hee ment euill, to Philippus his Predeceſſour.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3532:165"/> by the Emperour Decius, but onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a certaine ordinance and decree which hee made, after it had been a whole yeare before ſtirred vp by the Pagans, who were prouoked thereunto by reaſon of a certaine ſtirre and vprore. But whatſoeuer was the cauſe thereof, this is certaine, it was a terrible &amp; cruell perſecution, againſt the poore Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Nicephorus. li. <hi>5.</hi> Cap. <hi>29.</hi>

               <p>And as touching the kindes of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which they vſed againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, wee may eaſily iudge howe diuers and many they were, by the extract which Euſe.<note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> hath made, out of Dioniſius his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, touching the Martyres of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria: for hee maketh mention of boyling pitch, of ſtoning, of throwing or caſting ſharpe Reedes againſt their faces and eies, of trayning them vpon the pauementes of the ſtreets, of daſhing or cruſhing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtones, of beating, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, of burning, of percing the inwardes

And beſides all this, the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors went ſo farre aſtray, that they tooke away the chriſtians goods, bringing and leading the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians houſes, to pill and ſacke them, as men are wont to do, in ſome mutinie, ſtir, or ſedition, as we may behold in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Dioniſius, ſent to Fabianus, which ſaieth thus: That ſo long as this perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſted, all the whole multitude of the faithfull, were inforced to flee into the Mountaines, &amp; into the wilderneſſes, and to wander vp and downe, as vagabounds or ſtraying people, whereof ſome dyed with hunger, thirſt, cold, and diuers ſorts of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, other ſome were

               <p>The eight perſecution, was vnder Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincius Valerian, and Galien his ſonne, who were created Emperours, about the yeare of Chriſt, 255. and reigned fifteene yeares: Galien reigned together with his father, fiue or ſixe yeares, and the reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>7.</hi> Cap. <hi>10.</hi>

               <p>And the foreſaide Euſebius, addeth:<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>7.</hi> Cap. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> that Dioniſius writ theſe wordes, of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie exerciſed in Alexandria: This ſhould bee a thing ſuperfluous and more than needed, to recite the names of our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, ſeeing that the number is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and there were diuers which were vnknowne to mee. But yet know this, that amongeſt them there were of all ſorts of people, men, women, young, old, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, daughters, ſouldiours, handicraftes men, To bee ſhorte, of all conditions, and of all ages.</p>
               <p>As touching the names of torments, the Hiſtoriographers doe rehearſe them to bee diuers ſortes: they recken the whippe, wilde beaſtes, fire, the ſword, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and renting aſunder of bodies, long keeping them in dark priſons, where they made the Martyrs to wither and drie away with griefes and pininges: forbidding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to go to viſit them, laying to them fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; burning rods of iron to burn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>The ninth perſecution, was vnder Aurelian, who was created Emperour, in the yeare of Chriſt. 273. and reigned ſixe yeares.<note place="margin">Vincentius in ſpeculo.</note> Vincentius in his Mirrour or Glaſſe, layeth out and rehearſeth at large, a great many of the faithfull, which hee ſayeth, ſuffered Martyrdome vnder this Emperour, and addeth, that hee cauſed them to bee diligently ſought out in diuers places, &amp; at the laſt put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Italie:</hi> But by the writinges of other Authours woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie credite, it appeareth, that Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an did nothing els, but think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before hande, and deuiſe this perſecution, and did not execute it. For Eutropius, Vopiſcus, and Euſebius in his Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, haue written, That after this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had decreed the perſecution, hee
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3532:167"/> was ſodenly very much aſtoniſhed, with the deſtruction which would haue come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and verie quickly after hee was ſlaine. And Euſebius in his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory,<note place="margin">Euſeb. lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> ſpeaketh of him after this manner. It is true that Aurelian was then ſuche a one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs, that is to ſay, gentle, courteous, and a friende to Chriſtians, but in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement, growth and proceeding of his kingdome, hee did ſomewhat eſtraunge himſelfe from vs, inſomuche that beeing alreadie almoſte wonne by ſome Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, hee moued perſecution againſt vs, and great bruite or noyſe was thereof him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs. Notwithſtanding, euen then when hee was readie to perſecute vs, and had as it were ſubſcribed to the decree, whiche they were to publiſhe againſt vs, a certaine vengeaunce and wrath ſent from God, ſodenly ouertooke him, which cauſed this pernitious and hurtefull crueltie to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>The tenth perſecution, was vnder Diocleſian, and Maximianus Hercules. Diocleſian was eſtabliſhed Emperour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeere of our Lorde, 288. and aſſociating vnto him Maximianus, in the

               <p>Pomponius Laetus, in the abridgement of the Romane ſtories, reciteth, That Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian forgetting that hee was a man, and naming himſelfe the brother of the Sunne and the Moone, as though there had beene in him ſome diuine or heauenlye Maieſtie, made an edict and lawe, by which hee cammaunded that they ſhoulde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe him as God, and that all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difference of what raſe and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoeuer they were, ſhoulde kyſſe his feete, and for this ende, hee had ſhooes fluf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed and beſet with golde, and precious ſtones.</p>

               <p>Nowe this is to bee noted, that from the firſt Biſhop of Rome, vnto Sylueſter the firſt of that name (who was conſtituted and ſet vp in the yeere of Chriſte, 314.) there were thirtie and two Biſhops of Rome, all them ſuffered matyrdome. Since that time, the other Biſhops of Rome, for the moſte parte, yea almoſt all, haue duely gouerned and behaued themſelues, in the execution of their charge and offices, and in ſteede of the vowe of martyrdome, which their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours had, they haue vſurped another verie trimme haunt, they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues making themſelues in ſteede of the Pagane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Tyraunts and perſecutors of the Churche.

               <p>The firſt point is, that perſecutions and afflictions come not without the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and appointment of God. To this ende are to bee referred theſe places, <hi>I am the Lorde that forme the light,</hi>

               <p>Nowe this point or matter conteineth three argumentes and reaſons to comfort vs in the middeſt of our croſſes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The firſt is, that we are not in or vnder the power of fortune, or of men, but of God. The ſecond, that God doth iuſtly and for good cauſes afflict vs: for as he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and righteous in all his workes: ſo hee doth not ſend or lay vpon vs any affliction, but that which we haue indeede deſerued.<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>10.19.26.28.</hi> &amp;c.

                  </note> The <hi>3.</hi> that ſeeing the affliction wee ſuffer commeth from God our father, it ſhall not ouerwhelm or ouerthrow vs, but ſhal turne to our great good, ioy, and ſaluation. Now if the croſſe fall not from our ſhoulders, ſo long as this life laſteth God himſelfe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and willing to haue it ſo, let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber that which is ſaid of Lazarus &amp; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked rich man in S. Luke: <hi>Thou wicked man reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou in thy life time receiuedſt thy pleſure, &amp; likewiſe Lazarus paines. Now ther fore he is comforted and thou art tormented.</hi> The ſecond point is, wherefore God doth rather afflict his church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other people, as S. Peter ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Pet. 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The time is come that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> And there are 5. principall reaſons or cauſes heereof.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3532:175"/> The firſt, becauſe that by affliction, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth vnto vs, that he loueth vs, as he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thereof in the Prouerbes,<note place="margin">Pro. 3.11.12 Heb. 12.5.6.</note> and in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Hebrwes. Secondarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſeth GOD by this meanes to diſcerne vs that are his children from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and hypocrites, as the Authour of the Epiſtle to the Hebrwes declareth the ſame in the xii.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.8. <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>11.</hi>19.</note> Chapter: and for this cauſe alſo Saint Paule ſaide vnto the Corinthians: <hi>There muſt bee hereſies euen among you, that they which are approued among you might bee knowne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. <hi>1.2.</hi>3. 1. Pet. 1.7.</note> And Saint Iames, and Saint Peter doe for this very cauſe, call the afflictions of the faithfull <hi>trials of their faith.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they which know the will of their maſter and doe it not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. <hi>12.</hi>47.</note> 
                  <hi>are leſſe excuſable, yea ſhall bee beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſerueth to ſet out the iuſtice of god, to the ende wee ſhoulde not thinke that God winketh at the ſinnes of his people. Fiftly, becauſe it ſerueth alſo, to giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of inſtruction to the wicked: for as Ieſus Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Luke. <hi>23.</hi>31.</note> 
                  <hi>If they doe theſe thinges to a greene tree, what ſhall be done to the drye?</hi> And Saint Peter: <hi>If iudgement</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>firſt beginne at vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.<hi>17.</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>what ſhall bee the ende of them which obey not the Goſpell of God.</hi> And
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:3532:175"/> if the righteous ſcarcely bee ſaued, where ſhall the vngodly and the ſinner appeare?</p>
               <p>The thirde point, that the afflictions of the Churche and faithfull people, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes moderated &amp; kept in good meaſure by the hand of God himſelfe: For hee hath promiſed, that although he chaſten his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet he will not deſtroy them for al that.

But my mercie ſhall not depart away from him, as I tooke it from Saule, whom I haue put away before thee. For my names ſake will I deferre my wrath,</hi>

                  <hi>and for my promiſe I will refraine it from thee, that I cut thee not of. Beholde I haue fined thee, but not as ſiluer, I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen thee in the furnace of affliction,</hi>

                  <hi>Thy bruiſing is incurable, &amp; thy wound is dolorous. There is none to iudge thy cauſe, or to lay a plaiſter, there are no medicines nor helpe for thee: but I will reſtore health vnto thee, and will heale thee of thy woundes, ſaith the Lord,</hi>

When I ſend vpon Ieruſalem my foure ſore iudgements (ſaith the Lorde) that is to ſay, the ſword, &amp; famine, and the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome beaſt, and peſtilence to destroy man and beaſt out of it. Yet beholde therein ſhal bee left a remnant of them that ſhall bee carried away both ſonnes and daughters, and yee ſhall bee comforted. In their afflictions they will ſeeke mee diligently, ſaying: Come &amp; let vs returne to the Lorde, for hee hath ſpoyled, and hee will heale vs, he hath wounded vs, &amp; he wil bind vs vp. After two dayes will he reuiue vs, and in the thirde day hee will raiſe vs vp, and we ſhall liue in his ſight. There hath no temptation taken you,</hi>

               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:3532:176"/>
               <p>The fourth point, wherefore God doth not ſende ſuccour and aide to his Churche, ſo ſoone as it is afflicted. Certainely the croſſe is ſometimes ſo weightie and heauie vpon our ſhoulders, that it ſeemeth to vs that God ſleepeth, or els that hee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vs: as wee heare the complaints of Saints touching that matter in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Howe long wilt thou forget me O Lorde,</hi> ſaith Dauid,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Beeholde hee that keepeth Iſraell will neither ſlumber nor ſleepe:</hi> neither doth hee forget vs, as hee himſelfe aſſureth vs by his Prophet Iſaiah, when he ſaith.</p>

               <p>Wherefore then is it, that hee doeth not ſende vs ſuccour and aide without delay, thereby to deliuer vs from oppreſſion? It is firſt and formoſt, becauſe our ſinnes are the cauſe thereof.<note place="margin">Iſaia. 59, 1.<hi>2.</hi>
